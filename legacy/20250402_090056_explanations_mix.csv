1,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","This is my stop. Phil, you'll be CEO til 63rd street.","The caption implies that because this business meets on public transit, their leadership is determined by who is currently riding","The humor in this caption comes from the absurdity and unexpected juxtaposition of a corporate meeting taking place on a public bus or subway. Usually, business meetings and the appointment of a CEO are serious, well-organized events conducted in office settings. Here, the frivolity of making someone a temporary CEO based on the transit system stops adds a layer of surreal, comedic incongruity. This setting implies that leadership is transferred casually and temporarily, likening it to someone momentarily holding a bus or subway seat for another person until they reach their destination. The caption essentially mocks the gravity usually associated with corporate promotions by placing them in a mundane, everyday scenario of public transport, turning a significant role into something trivial and fleeting.",gpt-4o,openai,
2,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","Yes, I do miss the corporate jet. I miss the corporate jet very much.",This implies that holding meetings on public transit is a downgrade for the organization,"The joke plays on the stark contrast between corporate luxury and public transportation. The speaker, clearly an executive who once enjoyed the privilege of a corporate jet, is now conducting a business meeting on public transit—a drastically humbler mode of transportation. This suggests a financial downfall or budget cuts affecting the company.

The humor comes from the juxtaposition of the formal business meeting setting (people in business attire around a table) with the decidedly unglamorous environment of a bus or subway. The repetition in ""I miss the corporate jet very much"" emphasizes the speaker's lingering attachment to their former privilege, adding a layer of pathetic humor.

It's funny because it captures the absurdity of maintaining corporate formalities despite clear evidence of financial decline, highlighting how the executives are trying to maintain appearances while their reality has dramatically changed.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

The person at the head of the table is speaking.","Frank called to say he'll be late, he's stuck at the office.",This is specifically a wordplay reversing the more common phrase “being late to the office while stuck in transit”.,"The humor stems from the ironic reversal of typical work locations and commuting problems. The cartoon places a formal business meeting, usually held in a stationary office, onto a moving public transport vehicle. The caption then states Frank is late because he's ""stuck at the office."" This flips the common scenario where someone is stuck *in transit* (like on a bus or subway) and therefore late *for* the office. Here, the meeting *is* the transit, and the traditional office is ironically the place preventing Frank from reaching this unconventional, mobile meeting location.",gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25,gemini,

That floor was waxed last night!,"The woman's callous attitude towards the man in need contradicts what we expect from an emergency hotline worker, who typically aims to be helpful","The humor in this caption lies in the absurdity and misplaced priorities of the situation. The scenario is an ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE,"" implying that the people behind the desk are supposed to be addressing critical issues, likely to aid those in desperate situations. However, the woman host's concern is humorously trivial; instead of addressing the man's apparent distress, she focuses on the fact that the floor was recently waxed, suggesting an annoyance at the man's intrusion due to cleanliness concerns rather than his struggle. This unexpected and ridiculous reversal of priorities generates humor by highlighting the incongruity between the serious setting (an emergency hotline) and her comically inappropriate response to the severity of the situation.",gpt-4o,openai,

The joke suggests that the crawling, disheveled man (presumably Doug) is experiencing a genuine emergency warranting the use of an emergency hotline, but instead of offering help, the annoyed woman is scolding him for inappropriate timing or venue. The humor comes from the jarring juxtaposition of someone in obvious distress being criticized for etiquette rather than receiving assistance. It mocks bureaucratic callousness and the tendency of institutions to prioritize protocol over actual human suffering. The caption implies a prior relationship or ongoing pattern of behavior between Doug and the hotline staff, adding another layer of absurdity to what should be an impartial emergency service.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

The ""Emergency Hotline"" is clearly meant for urgent situations, yet the host ignores the man's plight and instead expresses annoyance that he physically came instead of simply calling. Suggesting he use ""roaming minutes"" implies the man *could* have easily phoned, trivializing his extreme situation and highlighting the hotline's absurd lack of empathy or helpfulness by focusing on inconvenient procedure over the actual emergency.",gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25,gemini,

Through the window is a view of outer space, with all of Earth visible. The window is open with the curtains drawn.",It's just the wind.,This is a play on words on the dual meaning of wind to mean either typical wind or solar wind.,"The humor in this caption arises from the absurdity and surreal nature of the situation. The husband dismisses the unusual sight of Earth from their bedroom window as something mundane, like the wind, which is a common and innocuous sound heard through an open window. This creates a humorous contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary; while one might expect a grand or concerned reaction to seeing Earth from space, the husband remains comically nonchalant. The joke plays on the understatement and the unexpected normalcy he assigns to a cosmic and implausible event, highlighting a classic New Yorker style of dry and understated humor.",gpt-4o,openai,

The window is open with the curtains drawn.",You always get like this when there's a full Earth.,"This caption reverses the idea of a ""full moon"" with a ""full earth""","This caption plays on the familiar concept of the ""full moon"" and how it's said to affect human behavior. Many folklore traditions suggest people act strangely during a full moon (the origin of terms like ""lunacy""). The husband is attributing his wife's current mood or behavior to there being a ""full Earth"" visible outside their window.

The humor comes from the role reversal - instead of being on Earth looking at a full moon, they're somewhere in space looking at a full Earth. The caption cleverly transposes this common earthly superstition to an extraterrestrial context, suggesting that even as space-dwelling beings, they maintain similar relationship dynamics and superstitions as Earth couples, just with Earth replacing the moon's mythological influence on behavior.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

","The humor arises from applying the mundane concept of ""buyer's remorse""—regret after a significant purchase—to the extraordinary situation depicted. The couple is clearly not on Earth, indicated by the view from their window. The husband assumes the wife's potential unease stems from regretting their ""purchase,"" which is implied to be their new life or home in space, presumably after leaving Earth behind. The joke lies in the massive understatement and the incongruity of treating the monumental decision to relocate off-planet like buying an expensive but ultimately ordinary item.",gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25,gemini,

On the island, a tiny bald man in glasses is sitting with a straight face, his hands on his knees.",We decided on separate vacations this year.,"This likens the fishbowl island to a beach resort, implying that the man is on vacation.","The humor in this caption lies in the absurdity and irony of the concept of ""separate vacations"" for the fish and the tiny man inside the fishbowl. The cartoon anthropomorphizes the fish and the tiny man, suggesting they have human-like lives and relationships. The fish are in the water while the tiny man, resembling a shipwreck survivor, is on a minuscule desert island within the same small fishbowl. The juxtaposition creates a visual pun, humorously implying that even though they are technically in the same space, they are having entirely different vacation experiences. This exaggerates the idea of separate vacations by placing them in a purely fictional and confined setting for comedic effect.",gpt-4o,openai,

She's treating a miniaturized human being—who appears to be stranded and uncomfortable—as if he were merely a disposable pet fish. The joke plays on the common practice of flushing unwanted goldfish down the toilet when children lose interest in them, but applies this callous attitude toward what is clearly a sentient human being. Her cheerful demeanor while discussing casually disposing of a person creates dark comedy through the extreme disconnect between her perception of the situation and the ethical horror of what she's suggesting. The caption reveals her as disturbingly oblivious to the man's humanity, treating him as a novelty item rather than a person with feelings and rights.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

I met a man at the pet store.,"This subverts the typical meaning of the phrase. Typically, this would mean that she met a normal man as a potential dating partner, but here, she purchased him as a pet.","The humor lies in the literal interpretation of the common phrase ""I met a man at the pet store."" Typically, this suggests a romantic encounter while shopping for pet supplies. However, the cartoon visually depicts the absurdity: the woman hasn't met a fellow shopper, but has literally acquired a *tiny man* who resides on a miniature desert island inside her fishbowl, presumably purchased *from* the pet store. The joke hinges on this misdirection – the mundane expectation created by the phrase versus the surreal, literal reality shown in the image.

The woman's eyebrows are slightly furrowed.","Okay. Now you be the naughty mosquito, and I'll be the tormented sporting goods salesman.",The caption attempts to explain the collection of goods as a sexual roleplay,"This caption creates humor through the absurdity and surreal nature of the role play described in the intimate setting. The cartoon already presents an unconventional and whimsical scene with their accessories—a football helmet, antenna headband, and a tennis racket—which primes the reader for something out of the ordinary. The joke lies in the unexpected and humorous roles the couple has chosen for their roleplay: a ""naughty mosquito"" and a ""tormented sporting goods salesman."" These roles are amusingly incongruent with a romantic bedroom setting. The odd combination of characters, along with the implied scenario of a mosquito interrupting a sporting goods salesman, adds a layer of ridiculousness that heightens the comedic effect. Additionally, it plays on the idea that the couple is intentionally taking their roles seriously, adding another layer of silliness to the situation.",gpt-4o,openai,

The presence of random items (antenna headband, football helmet, tennis racket) during their intimate moment suggests they're awkwardly attempting to spice up their love life with props, likely at their therapist's recommendation. The woman's furrowed brow indicates her skepticism about this approach, while the man's passive position suggests he's going along with it despite the obvious awkwardness. The punchline implies their current sex therapist has given them bizarre, ineffective advice that has led to this comically uncomfortable scenario rather than improved intimacy. The joke works by exposing the gap between professional sexual advice and its sometimes ridiculous real-world application.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

I think I have something in my teeth.,"This implies that the outline of the woman is her reflection, and that she's using the man's bald head as a mirror. ","The humor arises from the woman treating the man's extraordinarily large, bald, and reflective forehead as a convenient mirror. Instead of acknowledging its unusual size or the reflection itself, she focuses on a mundane personal issue – checking her teeth. The joke juxtaposes the absurd visual (a giant reflective forehead showing the woman's outline) with the banality of her request/statement. She is casually utilizing his prominent physical feature for a practical, everyday purpose, creating an unexpected and awkward situation.",gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25,gemini,

The woman, siting upright, is speaking.","Well, it's a lovely gesture, but I still think we should start seeing other people.","This implies that the image on his forehead is a tattoo, as getting a tattoo of your significant other is a common practice","This joke hinges on the humorous juxtaposition of romantic dedication being inadequately or awkwardly expressed. The cartoon depicts a man who is so infatuated with the woman that her image has somehow become imprinted on his enormous forehead, suggesting she is always on his mind. Despite this over-the-top display of affection, the woman responds with a clichéd breakup line: ""we should start seeing other people."" The humor lies in the man's grand gesture being overlooked or not reciprocated, as the woman is seemingly unaffected and focused on their incompatibility, making for an absurd contrast between his visible devotion and her indifferent relationship decision.",gpt-4o,openai,

One passerby tips his hat at the pastor and devil.",I think it's important for them to hear both sides of the debate.,It downplays the seriousness of religion by portraying the Devil as merely the “other side” in a casual debate,"The humor in this caption stems from presenting religion as a balanced debate between good and evil where ""both sides"" deserve equal consideration. The pastor's statement humorously implies that the Devil's perspective has legitimate standing that churchgoers should hear, treating eternal damnation as just an alternative viewpoint in a reasonable discussion. This subverts religious doctrine, which typically presents God's teachings as absolute truth and Satan as the embodiment of lies and temptation. The caption cleverly plays with modern discourse around ""hearing both sides"" of political or social issues, applying this concept absurdly to the ultimate moral binary in Christianity. The polite hat-tipping from the parishioner adds to the comedy by suggesting the congregation casually accepts this bizarre arrangement, as if the Devil were simply a guest speaker with a different opinion rather than their eternal adversary.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

The caption implies the pastor and the Devil were gambling, likely playing poker, with the souls of the congregation as the stakes. The Devil won the souls (""O.K., they're yours""), not through temptation or theological argument, but by cheating at cards (""where you got that fourth ace""). The joke subverts expectations of a grand spiritual battle, reducing it to a petty game where the Devil employs classic trickery, and the pastor seems more perplexed by the cheating method than the eternal damnation of his flock.",gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25,gemini,

","Whatever you do, don't agree to play hide-and-seek with him.",The man would be good at hide and seek because he is so small.,"The humor in this caption arises from the incongruity between the normal social context and the presence of a miniature-sized man at the party. The caption adds a layer of humor by referencing a child's game, ""hide-and-seek,"" which plays on the physical characteristic of the tiny man: his small size would grant him an unbeatable advantage in the game, as he could easily hide in places the others could not find. This adds an absurd element to the cocktail party, as the idea of sophisticated adults playing a children's game highlights the whimsicality and surreality of the tiny man's existence in their world. The humor lies in the unexpected, imaginative scenario created by juxtaposing adult sophistication with playful childlike elements.",gpt-4o,openai,

The literal meaning is a small refreshment station typically found in hotel rooms stocked with drinks and snacks. However, here it's reimagined as a bar that's specifically for miniature people—a place where the woman might logically meet her tiny companion. The humor comes from this wordplay that neatly explains their unusual pairing while using cocktail party-appropriate terminology. It creates a satisfying narrative logic for the bizarre sight of a normal-sized woman dating a tiny man, suggesting there are social spaces catering to such mixed-height couples, while simultaneously referencing a common feature of adult social life (bars and drinking establishments).",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

",Larry can't tell you about his current project—it's top secret.,This implies that the man's top-secret project caused him to become tiny.,"The humor arises from the juxtaposition of the visually absurd situation (a miniature man at a party) with a mundane, common social excuse.

Instead, his partner offers a standard deflection used when someone doesn't want to discuss work. This massive understatement creates irony.

The butterfly on the right is speaking to the other butterfly.",But how will we raise the kids?,This is a reference to a common conversation had in mixed race/ethnicity/religion households,"The humor in this caption comes from the juxtaposition of the natural and the artistic, as well as a play on traditional relationship dynamics. In the cartoon, one butterfly has wings that resemble a traditional butterfly's, while the other's wings mimic a famous modern art piece, creating an amusing visual contrast. The caption plays on themes of compatibility and concern in relationships—common topics in human partnerships—but presents them through butterflies, an unusual and humorous context. The question about raising kids suggests a worry about mixing fundamentally different 'genetics' or lifestyles: colorful, abstract art vs. typical butterfly wings. The absurdity of butterflies discussing raising offspring with artistic styles adds to the comedic effect.",gpt-4o,openai,

The joke connects Mondrian's abstract geometric compositions to Andy Warhol's famous Campbell's Soup Can paintings. By suggesting the butterfly's sister resembles Warhol's soup can art, the caption creates humor through:

1. Treating butterflies as if they could have their wing patterns resemble famous works of art
2. Implying these art-styled butterflies are a family trait
3. Showing the ""normal"" butterfly actually finds Warhol's style (soup can) stranger than Mondrian's geometric abstractions
4. Creating a clever bridge between two distinct modern art movements

The joke creates tension between the formal social setting and the inappropriately personal disclosure. It also subverts expectations by presenting the diving suit not as some eccentric fashion choice or hobby, but as an odd compromise in their relationship - she tolerates his strange attire because it serves a single mundane purpose, despite its romantic drawbacks.

By using the phrase ""It's almost recess,"" the caption humorously equates the situation to a school environment where a break or ""recess"" follows a class.

This creates humorous cognitive dissonance - we know elevators don't typically change one's orientation, yet the caption treats this bizarre situation as merely an inconvenience that requires ""getting used to."" The joke plays on the gap between the surreal visual and the mundane, matter-of-fact explanation that fails to address just how strange the situation actually is.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,
97,,79.0,"Two men in suits are standing on a sidewalk near a fire hydrant, looking up at an apartment building. All the windows on the building are rotated 90 degrees, so they appear sideways, including a man leaning out of one window, who is also rotated to match the window’s orientation. The two men on the sidewalk appear perplexed or curious about the unusual building.",I think I liked them the other way.,"Presumably, making the building sideways was a large undertaking that affected many people. Saying that he liked it the other way implies that all that effort was for nothing.","The humor arises from the massive understatement. The cartoon depicts a physically impossible and bizarre scenario – an apartment building with all its windows, and even an inhabitant leaning out, rotated 90 degrees sideways. Faced with this surreal architectural anomaly, the speaker doesn't react with shock, confusion, or questions about physics. Instead, the caption ""I think I liked them the other way"" treats the sideways windows as a mere aesthetic or design choice, like preferring horizontal to vertical blinds. It frames the impossible as a simple matter of preference, creating a comedic contrast between the extraordinary visual and the mundane, nonchalant critique.",gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25,gemini,

Rays of light shine down dramatically.",I gotta go. ‘Mr. Wonderful’ is having one of his episodes.,"By referring to God as ""Mr. Wonderful"" and calling the divine judgement an ""episode,"" Adam is characterizing God as a flawed, overly dramatic individual","The humor in the caption emerges from the juxtaposition of a mundane, modern-day cellphone conversation with the dramatic biblical scenario reminiscent of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The ""large hand extending from a cloud"" humorously represents the biblical depiction of God's presence. By referring to God as 'Mr. Wonderful' and suggesting He is 'having one of his episodes,' the caption playfully diminishes the grandeur and seriousness typically associated with divine interventions, portraying God's authoritative gesture as a melodramatic tantrum. This humorous trivialization of a religious myth creates an amusing contrast that relies on viewers' familiarity with both modern telephone etiquette and biblical iconography.",gpt-4o,openai,

But you wouldn't want to live here,The man is speaking about the Garden of Eden as if it's a vacation destination,"This caption plays with the biblical Garden of Eden narrative by recasting Adam's experience as that of a disappointed tourist or real estate shopper. The humor comes from reducing the profound spiritual fall of humanity to mundane consumer dissatisfaction - treating paradise as just another vacation spot or potential home that didn't live up to expectations. The ""first few days"" reference cleverly acknowledges the brief idyllic period before the forbidden fruit incident, while ""wouldn't want to live here"" ironically underplays their expulsion as a voluntary choice rather than divine punishment. The joke transforms the most consequential eviction in religious history into something akin to a bad Yelp review, creating humor through the incongruous application of modern casual attitude to a sacred narrative.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

The core joke is the juxtaposition of the immense, divine drama of God's confrontation with Adam after the original sin, and Adam's mundane, modern reaction. He treats God's accusatory appearance not as a cataclysmic event, but as an inconvenient interruption to his phone call. The punchline implies he is casually chatting with Satan, the instigator of the trouble, and prioritizes finishing that call over dealing with the immediate, wrathful presence of God, creating an absurd understatement of the situation's gravity.",gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25,gemini,
101,,83.0,"A group of people is sitting and talking casually in a living room. However, the room is filled with absurdly oversized household items, including giant lamps towering over the furniture and a massive telephone in the foreground. In the background, a separate room is visible, filled with a giant toaster and other huge kitchen appliances.","You know how it is—first you buy the giant-screen television, then nothing else seems to match.","This explains the large furniture as the result of everything feeling small after buying a large TV, an otherwise normal item","The humor in this caption stems from the comedic exaggeration and the literal visualization of a common sentiment about technology and home aesthetics. Typically, people might find that once they've brought a particularly large or advanced item into their home, such as a giant-screen TV, other items seem comparatively out of place, prompting consideration of upgrading or scaling up everything else to maintain aesthetic balance. The caption plays on this idea but takes it to an absurd level, suggesting that the logical next step would be to actually scale up all items to match a giant TV, resulting in hilariously enormous household objects dominating the living space. This exaggeration humorously reflects on consumer habits and the slippery slope of material acquisition.",gpt-4o,openai,

""It's down the hall"" is a standard response when someone asks for the bathroom location, but the warning ""don't fall in"" transforms this mundane exchange into humor by suggesting the toilet is so enormous that guests risk literally falling into it. The joke works on two levels: it acknowledges the absurdly oversized objects in the visible rooms while extending this visual premise to an unseen space, and it plays with the common expression of ""falling in"" which is normally figurative when referring to toilet mishaps. The humor emerges from the matter-of-fact delivery about an absurd situation, treating this giant-object world as completely normal except for this practical bathroom hazard.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

The cartoon shows giant household items, including a huge toaster. A giant toaster would presumably make giant toast. The caption, ""Would anyone like 1/68th of a piece of toast?"", implies that even this tiny fraction of the enormous toast is a reasonable, perhaps even standard, serving size for a normal person.

A golf flag is visible in the background, alongside scattered trees and clouds.","I support our troops as much as the next guy, but do we have to let them play through?",The army is also playing on the golf course,"The humor in this caption relies on the juxtaposition of a typical golf scenario with a military setting, creating an unexpected and absurd situation. Typically, when playing golf, one might ""let others play through"" if they are faster players—this is common golf etiquette. The caption humorously suggests that the golfers might have to extend this courtesy to an active military unit practicing or engaged in exercises on the ""course,"" which is humorously and absurdly imagined as filled with military hardware. The seriousness of the military equipment contrasts with the casual leisure of golf, creating a comically incongruous scenario. The phrase ""I support our troops as much as the next guy"" is a common expression of patriotism, adding irony since the speaker is bothered by the inconvenience of military presence rather than genuinely engaging with military support. This dual layer—sarcastic patriotism and absurd situation—yields the humor.",gpt-4o,openai,

The visual juxtaposition of a peaceful golf game with a militarized battleground setting creates immediate cognitive dissonance. The caption then reveals that one golfer has been yelling ""Bombs away!"" when hitting drives—a phrase actually used by military personnel when dropping explosives.

The humor emerges from multiple layers: First, the incongruity between the refined sport of golf and warfare imagery. Second, the revelation that Tom's innocent golf terminology might be misinterpreted given their surroundings, potentially attracting unwanted military attention or response. It suggests their golfing has accidentally brought them into a war zone, or their recreational activity is being mistaken for something more threatening.

The caption perfectly bridges the visual disconnect by providing a plausible explanation for why these golfers find themselves in such dangerous territory—someone's unfortunate choice of golf terminology.",claude-3-7-sonnet-latest,claude,

The caption treats playing golf not as a recreational choice, but as a deeply held conviction or duty (""If we truly believe in golf...""). It absurdly elevates the golfers' dedication to their hobby to the level of ideological commitment, suggesting that their ""belief"" compels them to play even on a battlefield, as if golf itself is a cause worth braving extreme peril for.

107,,92.0,"A man and a woman stand on a city sidewalk. The man is reaching into his pocket as if to give something to a dolphin standing upright on its tail, which is holding out a cup in a begging gesture. The woman, appearing angry, is yelling at the man, likely in protest of his action.","Come on, George. You know he's only going to spend it on more oxygen.",A common argument for not giving money to beggars is the belief that they'll spend the money on alcohol or drugs.,"The humor in this caption arises from the anthropomorphism of a dolphin as a panhandler in a city setting, and the play on a common social issue regarding panhandling. The woman is angry at the man, George, for giving money to the dolphin, implying the donation would be misused—a common stereotype about how some people believe panhandlers might spend donations irresponsibly. Here, the joke is that while a human beggar might be stereotypically expected to purchase alcohol or drugs, a dolphin would spend it on 'more oxygen,' which is a humorous twist since dolphins naturally live in water and would indeed require oxygen. This unexpected substitution plays on readers' expectations and creates humor by highlighting the absurdity of a dolphin 'needing' to spend on something that comes naturally.",gpt-4o,openai,
