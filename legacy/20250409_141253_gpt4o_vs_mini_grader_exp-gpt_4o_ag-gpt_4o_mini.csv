1,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","This is my stop. Phil, you'll be CEO til 63rd street.","The caption implies that because this business meets on public transit, their leadership is determined by who is currently riding","This caption creates humor through the absurdity of combining a serious business setting with a mundane public transportation experience. The joke hinges on the unexpected scenario of a business leader treating the role of CEO as a temporary position determined by train stops, rather than the weighty responsibility and commitment it typically entails. Inverting the serious nature of corporate hierarchy into something as casual and transient as a bus or subway ride is the source of humor. The concept of a CEO changing every few subway stops is ludicrous, as it satirizes corporate and public transport routines, portraying a CEO role with the triviality and temporariness akin to passengers hopping on and off at their respective stops.",PASS,"The student's answer effectively captures the comedic element highlighted in the anticipated answer point. It discusses the absurdity of treating a serious role, such as a CEO, as a temporary position tied to public transit stops, which aligns with the idea that leadership is determined by who is currently riding. The response emphasizes the humor in the situational irony and the transient nature of roles in this setting. Therefore, the key comedic element is addressed.",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 158, ""tokens_out"": 141}",gpt-4o-mini,"{""tokens_in"": 471, ""tokens_out"": 101}"
2,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","Yes, I do miss the corporate jet. I miss the corporate jet very much.",This implies that holding meetings on public transit is a downgrade for the organization,"The humor arises from the incongruity between the usual setting of a business meeting and its unexpected location inside a bus or subway car, which is typically a place for public transit rather than a corporate setting. The joke further builds on this contrast by having the speaker nostalgically mention the corporate jet, an emblem of luxury and exclusivity in the business world. The juxtaposition of the current setting (a mundane and cramped public bus or subway) with the luxurious corporate jet highlights the stark difference in status and comfort, playing on the theme of a fall from grace or reduced company perks. The humor lies in this exaggeration and absurdity of conducting serious corporate business in a setting that is anything but high-end.",PASS,"The student's answer effectively captures the key comedic element of the anticipated answer point by discussing the contrast between the corporate jet and the public transit setting, indicating that having meetings in such a place is indeed a downgrade. The mention of the nostalgic reference to the corporate jet and the analysis of the situation confirms this aspect of reduced status. Thus, the answer aligns with the anticipated point.",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 159, ""tokens_out"": 148}",gpt-4o-mini,"{""tokens_in"": 472, ""tokens_out"": 91}"
3,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","Frank called to say he'll be late, he's stuck at the office.",This is specifically a wordplay reversing the more common phrase “being late to the office while stuck in transit”.,"The humor in this caption comes from the unexpected and absurd visual setting of a formal business meeting taking place inside a bus or subway car, combined with the literal language in the caption. The caption portrays Frank's location as being ""stuck at the office,"" which is a common excuse for being late. The joke lies in the literal interpretation of the office being the bus or subway car, where the meeting is happening. This juxtaposition creates a humorous contrast between the expectation of an office environment for a meeting and the reality of being in transit. The incongruity between the normal settings of a business meeting and the depicted scene, along with the familiar excuse re-contextualized in this setting, generates the comedic effect.",FAIL,"The student’s answer provides a detailed explanation of the humor, discussing the unexpected setting and the juxtaposition between the office and the bus. However, it does not explicitly mention the wordplay or the reversal of the common phrase about being late to the office. Therefore, it fails to cover the specific comedic element highlighted in the anticipated answer point.",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 156, ""tokens_out"": 150}",gpt-4o-mini,"{""tokens_in"": 478, ""tokens_out"": 84}"
4,,3.0,"4 people in fancy attire sit behind a desk wearing gooseneck microphones, possibly in a game show or telethon. Behind them is a sign that reads in bold text ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE"". In front of them, a discheveled man in tattered clothes is crawling, looking up at them. The hosts are looking at the man with flat expressions. One host in the middle, a woman, leans over the desk with both hands, yelling angrily at the man crawling on the ground.",This better be good. That floor was waxed last night!,"The woman's callous attitude towards the man in need contradicts what we expect from an emergency hotline worker, who typically aims to be helpful","The humor in this caption arises from the unexpected and incongruous reaction of the host. Typically, in a scenario labeled as an ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE,"" one would expect empathy or urgent assistance, especially considering the man appears to be in distress, crawling and disheveled. Instead, the host's priority is the cleanliness of the floor, which is humorous because it trivializes the emergency and highlights a misplaced concern in a dramatic and wrong context. This absurd prioritization generates comedy by contrasting the serious setup against an irrelevant complaint, subverting expectations of how emergency situations should be addressed.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly covers the key comedic element by discussing the unexpected and callous reaction of the host towards the crawling man, highlighting the contrast between the serious nature of an emergency hotline and the trivial concern about the floor's cleanliness.

One host in the middle, a woman, leans over the desk with both hands, yelling angrily at the man crawling on the ground.","Neither the time nor the place, Doug!","Typically, the emergency hotline is exactly the time and place for a person in need of help.","The humor in this caption lies in the juxtaposition of the setting and the expected purpose of an ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE"" versus the dismissive response the desperate man receives. Traditionally, an emergency hotline is intended as a place where people can seek urgent help and support. The caption, ""Neither the time nor the place, Doug!"", humorously subverts this expectation by portraying the hotline staff as unsympathetic and treating Doug's apparent crisis as an inconvenient intrusion. There's an ironic and absurd element in the idea that an emergency hotline would have a 'wrong time or place' for dealing with emergencies. By addressing him by name, the caption adds an element of personal familiarity, which compounds the humor, implying perhaps Doug frequently disrupts with emergencies only to be brushed off. The formal, irreverent language usually reserved for private disagreements adds to the comedic effect through contrast.",PASS,"The student's answer effectively covers the anticipated answer point by discussing the juxtaposition of the emergency hotline's expected purpose versus the dismissive reaction of the hosts. They highlight the irony that an emergency hotline would dismiss someone in crisis, thus explicitly addressing the point that it's typically the right time and place for such situations. The analysis of the humor and the use of irony align well with the comedic logic outlined in the anticipated answer point.",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 211, ""tokens_out"": 183}",gpt-4o-mini,"{""tokens_in"": 563, ""tokens_out"": 100}"

One host in the middle, a woman, leans over the desk with both hands, yelling angrily at the man crawling on the ground.",Would it kill you to use a few of your roaming minutes?,"The caption implies that the man is only visiting the hotline in person because it would have been an expensive phone call, a seemingly minor problem compared to whatever emergency the man is in","The humor in this caption stems from the incongruity between the dire situation depicted and the triviality displayed by the hosts of the ""Emergency Hotline."" The disheveled man crawling towards the hosts suggests that he is in urgent need of help, playing into the expectation that an emergency hotline would be a source of assistance. However, the caption flips this expectation by focusing on the man's failure to use his ""roaming minutes,"" a reference to mobile phone plans. The woman's unnecessarily irritable response trivializes the situation further, as it implies that the man could easily have called ahead using his phone minutes. This mismatch between the life-or-death implications of an 'emergency' and the mundane concern over phone minutes creates absurdity and humor by highlighting the misplaced priorities and the callousness of the hotline staff.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly discusses the incongruity between the man's urgent situation and the hotline's trivial concern about roaming minutes, indicating that the man is present in person due to the cost of a phone call. This aligns with the anticipated answer point which focuses on the contrasting priorities of the emergency hotline and the man’s plight.",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 215, ""tokens_out"": 170}",gpt-4o-mini,"{""tokens_in"": 571, ""tokens_out"": 80}"

Through the window is a view of outer space, with all of Earth visible. The window is open with the curtains drawn.",It's just the wind.,This is a play on words on the dual meaning of wind to mean either typical wind or solar wind.,"The humor in this caption arises from the juxtaposition of a mundane excuse with an extraordinary scenario. The phrase ""It's just the wind"" is a common, calming response to strange noises or movements that a person might hear or feel, typically suggesting there's nothing to worry about. However, in this cartoon, the presence of an open window showing outer space and the entire Earth contradicts the notion of mere wind being responsible. This absurd situation transforms the commonplace reassurance into an understatement, as the idea of ""wind"" blowing in from outer space is not only impossible but underscores the fantastical nature of the scene. The humor lies in the contrast between the familiar and the preposterous.",FAIL,"The student's answer discusses the contrast between the common phrase ""It's just the wind"" and the extraordinary setting of outer space, capturing the absurdity of using a mundane explanation for a fantastical situation. However, it does not explicitly mention the wordplay on the dual meaning of ""wind"" (typical wind vs. solar wind), which is the key comedic element of the caption.

The window is open with the curtains drawn.",You always get like this when there's a full Earth.,"This caption reverses the idea of a ""full moon"" with a ""full earth""","This caption plays on the concept of a ""full moon,"" which is often humorously associated with changes in behavior or mood, sometimes attributing unusual activities or heightened irritability to it. Instead of referencing a full moon, the caption creatively swaps it with a ""full Earth,"" as seen through the window in their room, implying that the characters are now situated elsewhere, possibly on another planet or the moon itself. The humor arises from the absurdity and unexpectedness of reversing the common trope and considering how, in this fantastical new home in outer space, a ""full Earth"" might similarly be associated with behavioral changes. The caption leverages the juxtaposition of the familiar and the absurd, as it treats the outlandish notion of having a ""full Earth"" visible from your bedroom window in the same casually exasperated way partners might discuss the notion of lunar-induced mood changes.",PASS,"The student's answer effectively captures the key comedic element of reversing the idea of a ""full moon"" with a ""full Earth."" They explain how the caption replaces the common trope associated with the moon with a humorous twist involving the Earth, demonstrating an understanding of the joke's premise.

The window is open with the curtains drawn.","Relax, honey—everybody gets buyer's remorse","This caption gives the cartoon a backstory, acknowledging that outer space is an odd location for a house and implying that the woman is not entirely satisfied with it. ","The humor in the caption comes from a play on the phrase ""buyer's remorse,"" which typically refers to the regret someone feels after making a large or hasty purchase. In the cartoon, the couple is in bed with a view of Earth from outer space, suggesting they are in some kind of spacecraft or otherworldly setting. Earth appearing through the window implies they are far from home, possibly on a one-way trip or permanent relocation, which could be seen as the ""purchase"" they are regretting. The husband's remark attempts to reassure the wife by diminishing their massive life decision to a common consumer experience, highlighting the absurdity of treating interplanetary travel as casually as buying a new car or home. This contrast between the enormity of leaving Earth and the triviality of ""buyer's remorse"" creates the comedic tension needed for the joke.",PASS,"The student's answer captures the essence of the caption by discussing the absurdity of the situation through the lens of ""buyer's remorse."" They explicitly mention the contrast between the enormity of their situation (being in space) and the triviality of the phrase used, effectively incorporating the concept of dissatisfaction with their new and odd location.

On the island, a tiny bald man in glasses is sitting with a straight face, his hands on his knees.",We decided on separate vacations this year.,"This likens the fishbowl island to a beach resort, implying that the man is on vacation.","The humor in this caption lies in the absurdity of anthropomorphizing the fishbowl environment as a vacation destination. Typically, separate vacations would imply a human couple choosing distinct travel destinations. However, in this scenario, the tiny bald man, likely a pet or part of a whimsical setup within the fishbowl, is treated as someone taking an independent vacation inside this miniature bottled world. The comedic twist comes from the juxtaposition of everyday human activities, such as planning a vacation, with the tiny scale and unconventional setup of having one ""vacation"" on a miniature island within a fishbowl. This unexpected transformation of a fishbowl into a vacation setting along with the man’s expressionless demeanor adds to the humor.",PASS,"The student's answer discusses the concept of separate vacations and the absurdity of the fishbowl as a vacation destination, which captures the essence of likening the fishbowl island to a beach resort. The mention of the man being part of a whimsical setup also implies that he is on vacation, aligning with the anticipated point. Therefore, the student effectively conveys the comedic logic presented in the original caption.",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 165, ""tokens_out"": 154}",gpt-4o-mini,"{""tokens_in"": 490, ""tokens_out"": 96}"
