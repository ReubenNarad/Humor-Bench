3,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","Frank called to say he'll be late, he's stuck at the office.",This is specifically a wordplay reversing the more common phrase “being late to the office while stuck in transit”.,"The humor in this caption stems from the absurd role reversal it presents. In a normal workplace scenario, someone might be late to a meeting because they're stuck in transit or on public transportation. Here, the joke flips that expectation - Frank is late because he's stuck at the office while the meeting itself is taking place on public transportation.

The caption cleverly plays with our understanding of fixed and mobile spaces. Traditionally, the office is the stationary location where meetings happen, while transit is the moving space between destinations. This cartoon inverts that relationship by making the office the place one gets ""stuck"" while the moving vehicle becomes the official meeting venue.

The humor is enhanced by how matter-of-factly the speaker delivers this information, suggesting this bizarre mobile meeting arrangement is completely normal for this company, highlighting the absurdity of modern work culture where the boundaries between commuting time and work time have increasingly blurred.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly covers the anticipated answer point by discussing the role reversal and inversion of expectations, using different wording to describe the comedic flips.

The window is open with the curtains drawn.",You always get like this when there's a full Earth.,"This caption reverses the idea of a ""full moon"" with a ""full earth""","This caption cleverly inverts the familiar notion of the ""full moon"" affecting human behavior. In folklore, a full moon is often blamed for causing people to act strangely or emotionally (hence terms like ""lunacy""). 

Here, the couple is clearly living somewhere off-planet (the moon, perhaps), and the husband is treating their extraordinary circumstance as mundane domestic life. By suggesting his wife ""always gets like this"" during a ""full Earth,"" he's applying the same folk wisdom about lunar effects to Earth instead.

The humor works on multiple levels: it creates an amusing role reversal (Earth is now the celestial body influencing behavior rather than the moon), it normalizes the extraordinary (living in space has become so routine they have recurring marital squabbles about it), and it suggests that no matter how far humans venture from Earth, we'll still blame our moods on celestial bodies.

",We met at the mini bar.,"This combines the typical phrase ""we met at a bar"" with the term minibar, because the man himself is miniature.","The humor in this caption comes from a clever wordplay on ""mini bar."" In hotels, a mini bar is a small refrigerator with drinks and snacks. Here, the caption transforms this familiar term into a literal joke about the man's miniature size. 

The woman is explaining how she met her tiny partner at what sounds like a regular location (a bar), but the word ""mini"" creates a double meaning that perfectly explains the unusual pairing. It suggests either a bar specifically for tiny people or that the regular-sized woman found her miniature partner at a small hotel fridge—both absurd scenarios that explain the visual incongruity.

The caption implies he somehow thought a diving suit was a reasonable option for a cocktail party and is only now realizing his error—yet he's understating the magnitude of his mistake as though the problem is merely one of appearance rather than complete contextual inappropriateness.

It plays on the well-known ability of parrots to mimic human speech, suggesting this corporate setting has employed them as living ""recorders"" of their discussions. The joke works because it provides an absurd but logical explanation for the bizarre presence of parrots in a professional boardroom.

The angry exchange between executives implies this system is failing - perhaps the parrots are repeating confidential information outside the meeting, squawking at inappropriate times, or simply not accurately capturing the discussions. The caption cleverly transforms what looks like an absurd situation into a flawed corporate solution to documentation, poking fun at both inefficient business practices and the lengths organizations might go to before adopting sensible technology.

It cleverly plays on several established tropes: the urban/rural political divide in American politics, the stereotype of coastal elites versus heartland voters, and the formal Washington DC briefing setting (confirmed by the Washington Monument in the background).

The pasta choices themselves enhance the humor - tortellini as small, traditional, and hearty fits the stereotype of middle America, while risotto as more sophisticated and cosmopolitan matches coastal stereotypes.

The person in the full rabbit costume has confused Easter traditions (the Easter Bunny) with Good Friday observance, and mistakenly believed there was a ""casual Good Friday"" dress code similar to casual Friday.

The joke works through several layers: First, the inappropriate extreme of wearing a full Easter Bunny costume to work; second, the fundamental misunderstanding of Good Friday (a solemn religious observance) as a casual dress-up opportunity; and third, the character's obliviousness to how out of place they appear.

The humor works on multiple levels: it plays with the absurdity of a male pregnancy by suggesting it must be miraculous in nature, while simultaneously poking fun at how people dismiss religious miracles until personally affected. There's also an undertone of gender role reversal, as the caption adapts a typically female-specific experience (unexpected pregnancy and needing to explain it) to a male context.

The humor derives from parodying a common pregnancy announcement phrase (""The ultrasound says it's a boy/girl"") but replacing the expected gender reveal with ""a keg of Bud Light."" This twist creates a mockery of both medical procedures (ultrasounds) and the physical effects of excessive beer consumption.

The joke works by establishing a logical explanation for the impossible scenario depicted in the cartoon while simultaneously poking fun at beer culture and the physical consequences of drinking too much.

The humor comes from the implication that the woman has just had an intimate encounter with the snowman (represented by the snow globe) that left her unsatisfied. Her state of undress and disgruntled expression, coupled with the snowman ""in bed"" with her, creates a visual narrative of a sexual encounter gone wrong.

The punchline hinges on the dual meaning of ""waspy"": literally referring to wasps (a type of insect that might be related to or rivals of the bug husband), and the colloquial term ""WASP"" (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant), suggesting social class considerations.

On another level, ""obscene hours"" is a common expression for unreasonably long or difficult work schedules, connecting to the man's anxious expression and suggesting he's complaining about his workplace's demanding time requirements.

This creates perfect irony: one giraffe claims to be trying to see from the other's viewpoint, yet even with their bodies contorted together, they're still literally looking in different directions.

The joke works because it transforms an abstract concept (understanding another's perspective) into a concrete, visual situation (physically trying to see what another sees). The humor is heightened by using giraffes—animals defined by their long necks—in this scenario of physical entanglement.

In musical terminology, ""coming in on four"" refers to when a musician should begin playing (on the fourth beat of a measure). However, in the elevator context, it could be interpreted as telling someone to enter the elevator on the fourth floor.

The humor stems from this clever wordplay between musical and spatial contexts. The tuba players, thinking in musical terms, are casually discussing timing with the potential elevator passenger.

The humor derives from the perfect double meaning of ""grounds"" - simultaneously referring to coffee grounds from the espresso machine and the physical ground/terrain that cowboys would typically be examining. This wordplay creates a delightful collision between the rugged Old West setting and the incongruously modern coffee culture represented by the espresso machine.

The speaker's formal request for ""less disclosure"" creates a perfect pun—they're using proper corporate meeting language to essentially ask if they can put some clothes on. The irony is particularly sharp because shareholder meetings are typically events where investors demand more transparency, not less.

The caption also works because it maintains the businesslike tone of the setting (parliamentary procedure with ""Do I hear a motion..."") while addressing the absurdly inappropriate situation.

In medieval times, knights were expected to show courtesy to others, including acts like opening doors for people (particularly women). However, the knight has literally impaled a car door with his lance, taking the concept of ""opening doors"" to a destructive, literal extreme.

The joke creates humor through the incongruous collision of two American cultures: the rugged, traditional Old West (represented by the cowboys) confronting modern, urban coffee culture (the sophisticated espresso machine) that has somehow invaded their territory.

Knights traditionally rescue people from danger, but here the armor-clad character has taken a figurative expression (""dinner needs saving/rescuing"") literally, showing up in full battle gear to ""save"" a meal.

The incongruity between medieval chivalry and modern kitchen disasters creates an absurd juxtaposition.

There's also humor in the knight's earnest misunderstanding of the situation - he has gallantly arrived for a rescue mission but is completely ill-equipped to handle culinary problems.

The joke works because the doctor is informing the king that his condition is not just a cold, but a ""common"" cold—which would be particularly offensive to someone of royal standing who is accustomed to everything in their life being exceptional, rare, or royal. The humor stems from the king's presumed horror at contracting something so pedestrian as a ""common"" illness, suggesting that the diagnosis is worse for his royal ego than for his actual health.

On the desk are a notepad, pens, a telephone keypad, and a framed photo.",Can I call you back? I’m with a piece of string.,"This mimics the phrase, ""I'm with a client,"" implying the cat's job is to play with the string","This caption plays on the well-known feline fascination with string. The humor emerges from the juxtaposition between the cat's professional, human-like appearance (business suit, office setting, important phone call) and its innate cat instincts. Despite appearing to be a serious businesscat, he's interrupting what is presumably a professional call because he's distracted by a piece of string - something trivial in human business contexts but irresistible to cats.

The anthropomorphic cat is trying to maintain professional decorum (""Can I call you back?"") while simultaneously revealing his true feline nature. The comedy lies in how he treats the string as if it's an important meeting or client that demands his immediate attention, elevating a silly cat distraction to the status of legitimate business priority. It's essentially a ""cats will be cats"" punchline in a corporate setting.",PASS,"The student's answer successfully identifies the comedic element by explaining how the cat treats the string with the importance typically reserved for a client or serious business matter.

491,CS175002,,"In an office hallway, two men in suits walk past each other. One man holds a briefcase at his side and the other man carries a large chair in both arms, speaking as he does so. In the background, another man and a woman, also in business attire, walk by.",What did you take away from the meeting?,"While ""take away"" typically refers to ideas, here the man is literally taking something (the chair) away from the meeting","The humor in this caption hinges on the double meaning of the phrase ""take away from the meeting."" Normally, when someone asks what you ""took away"" from a meeting, they're inquiring about the insights, information, or conclusions you gained—a metaphorical ""taking."" 

However, the cartoon subverts this expectation by showing one businessman literally carrying away a chair from what we can assume was a meeting room. This creates a perfect visual pun where ""take away"" is interpreted in its most literal sense—physically removing an object.

The joke works because it cleverly transforms a common business idiom into an unexpected literal action. The contrast between the ordinary briefcase-carrying businessman (who likely ""took away"" information) and his colleague who physically removed furniture creates an absurd juxtaposition that highlights corporate culture's tendency to speak in metaphors while someone has misinterpreted the instruction in the most concrete way possible.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly covers the anticipated answer point by explaining the double meaning of ""take away from the meeting,"" which usually refers to insights gained but is humorously interpreted literally as physically removing a chair.

On the literal level, the man is scolding his cat for not using the litter box properly—presumably the cat has relieved itself somewhere inappropriate. But the caption brilliantly repurposes the business cliché ""think outside the box"" (meaning to think creatively or unconventionally) for this domestic pet situation. The humor emerges from the contrast: while innovative thinking is typically encouraged in professional settings (suggested by the man's business attire), here the man demands strict adherence to convention. The caption transforms the aspirational corporate jargon into a stern, literal command about bathroom habits. This juxtaposition of high-minded business philosophy with the mundane reality of pet ownership creates the comedic effect.",PASS,"The student's answer clearly captures the dual meaning and ironic twist of the caption.

The joke works through a deliberate double meaning of ""tricks"": for dogs, tricks are literal commands they perform (sit, roll over, fetch), but the advice mirrors human wisdom about learning skills during youth. 

The older dog is positioned as a mentor figure, dispensing life wisdom in a way that feels both specific to dog experience and universally applicable to humans. It's funny because it reframes the typical dog-human relationship (where humans teach dogs tricks) into a dog-to-dog mentorship.

The caption also carries a subtle poignancy—the older dog implying that flexibility and learning capacity diminish with age, which resonates with human experience. The humor emerges from this seamless blending of animal reality with human concerns about aging and skill acquisition.",PASS,"The student's answer does capture the key comedic element by discussing the play on ""tricks"" and the idea of learning them while young, which aligns with the anticipated idiom ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks.""

The caption cleverly plays with the concept of a ""wake-up call"" in two senses: literally, as a hotel service or morning phone reminder, and metaphorically, as a harsh reality check that forces reflection. The phrase ""change or die"" transforms what appears to be an ordinary bedroom scene into something much more consequential—perhaps a doctor delivering grave health news, a threat from someone dangerous, or even the man's own internal reckoning.

The elderly speaker is making a wistful joke about two different sixties: the cultural period of the 1960s (known as the ""swinging sixties"" for its sexual liberation and counterculture) and the age decade of being in one's 60s. 

The comedic tension comes from the absurdity of his statement. As an elderly man already well beyond his 60s in age, he's either:
1) Implying he'll somehow get another chance at experiencing the historical 1960s when they ""come around"" again (impossible)
2) Suggesting he'll live until the 2060s (equally implausible given his age)
3) Making a circular time joke about aging backward

The term ""swinging"" adds an additional layer of humor, referencing both the cultural freedoms of the era and potentially the sexual liberation of ""swinger"" culture, which creates a mildly risqué undertone of an elderly man regretting missing out on wild times in his youth.

The joke works through its poignant combination of nostalgia, impossible hopes, and the universal experience of regretting missed opportunities.",FAIL,"The student's answer does not explicitly address the anticipated answer point that the elderly man implies a preference for the cultural 1960s over the age range of being in one's 60s.
