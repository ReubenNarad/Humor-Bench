The husband’s line, “You always get like this when there’s a full Earth,” substitutes “Earth” for “Moon,” treating Earth’s fully lit disk as the lunar equivalent of a “full Moon.”  The humor comes from this perspective reversal: what is a commonplace marital complaint on Earth becomes an identical complaint from a moon-dweller, exposing the arbitrariness of the superstition while giving an everyday domestic gripe a cosmic scale.",PASS,"The student's answer effectively discusses the key comedic element, which is the reversal of the idea of a ""full moon"" with a ""full earth.""

However, the man is bald, and has a cartoonishly large forehead, with the outline of the woman visible on his forehead. The woman, siting upright, is speaking.","Well, it's a lovely gesture, but I still think we should start seeing other people.","This implies that the image on his forehead is a tattoo, as getting a tattoo of your significant other is a common practice","The drawing shows that the man is literally “carrying her around in his head”: her silhouette is stamped across his huge bald forehead. It’s a cartoon way of saying she’s always on his mind, maybe even that he had her image tattooed there just to prove his devotion. The caption’s first clause—“it’s a lovely gesture”—acknowledges this over-the-top display of affection. The punch line follows: “but I still think we should start seeing other people.” That line is the standard, politely formulaic breakup phrase, yet it clashes comically with the man’s forehead billboard showing absolute, single-minded commitment. The humor comes from the stark mismatch between his extreme romantic gesture (he can’t think about anyone else) and her calmly announced intention to end the exclusivity of the relationship. In other words, he’s made it impossible for himself to “see other people,” while she’s using the phrase in the conventional dating sense, creating an ironic double meaning.",PASS,"The student’s answer explicitly discusses the man's forehead displaying a silhouette of the woman, comparing it to a tattoo, and how it symbolizes his devotion.

One butterfly looks ordinary; the other’s wings are an abstract Mondrian painting—far outside normal butterfly coloration. The stark stylistic mismatch mimics a big cultural gap. By having the ordinary butterfly ask, “But how will we raise the kids?”, the caption transfers a very human anxiety (which religion? what traditions?) onto insects, whose “kids” would automatically inherit wing patterns through genetics, not parenting.

The caption uses detective jargon (“solid lead”) and talks about the patient’s liver as if it were a stolen possession, turning a vital internal organ into a pilfered object like a wallet. The absurdity is reinforced visually: the trench-coated, sunglasses-wearing figure lurking behind the doctor looks like a private eye, confirming that the doctor has apparently teamed up with law enforcement to solve an “organ theft.” The clash between medical reality (you can’t be sitting there without a liver) and crime-story language creates the joke.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly addresses the comedic device of combining medical and detective scenarios, referring to both the caption's use of crime-scene language and the visual presence of a trench-coated figure as confirming a detective-like role.

The woman bitterly compares her situation to that of another classic movie monster couple, the Bride of Frankenstein and Frankenstein’s monster, assuming that even a sewn-together corpse manages some post-romantic snuggling.

The speaker (the bartender on the phone) foresees exactly that and sighs, “It’s gonna be one of those long nights of playing devil’s advocate.” 

“Playing devil’s advocate” normally means arguing the opposite side just to test an idea, but here it carries two extra layers: 
1) Because clergy are devoted to fighting the Devil, anyone who argues against them is, by definition, the “devil’s” advocate. 
2) In Catholic tradition there really was an official “Devil’s Advocate” who tried to poke holes in a candidate’s sainthood—a role priests would recognize.

So the caption melds the cliché bar-joke setup with the idiom, suggesting the bartender will spend the evening locked in head-spinning theological sparring with holy men, literally taking the Devil’s side for argument’s sake.
