Transferring that off-hand attitude to an actual (though shrunken) human makes the remark grotesque and funny: a person is being valued no more than a disposable goldfish.

By saying the congregants must “hear both sides of the debate,” he treats eternal salvation versus damnation like a modern talk-show issue that demands equal airtime for opposing viewpoints. The humor comes from transplanting the media/political mantra of “balanced coverage” into a church, where giving the Devil the floor is the last thing expected.

Here, the doctor says they’ll “beat it out of you,” a phrase associated with gangsters forcing information from someone. The mysterious trench-coated figure behind the doctor looks like a hired bruiser, reinforcing the threat.

He tries to rationalize the impossibility by invoking “the immaculate conception,” the biblical event in which Mary became pregnant without intercourse. The line “No one expects an immaculate conception until it happens to him” humorously flips both biology and theology: (1) only women can get pregnant, so a man claiming it happened to “him” is inherently ridiculous; (2) the phrase “no one expects…” echoes clichés like “it can’t happen to me,” making his calm acceptance funnier.

Snow globes that feature the Manhattan skyline are common tourist trinkets; here one has been enlarged and plopped, incongruously, onto the bed beside a half-dressed woman who looks as if she has just woken up with it. By saying “I think the Manhattan skyline is getting suspicious,” she speaks as though the tiny buildings inside the globe can observe and judge whatever compromising activity has just happened between her and the unseen partner.

The husband warns, “Just don't order a Bloody Mary.” In a normal bar, a Bloody Mary is simply a vodka-tomato-juice cocktail. In a church, however, “Mary” evokes the Virgin Mary and anything described as “bloody” inside a sanctuary sounds sacrilegious. The line therefore functions as a playful etiquette tip: you might get away with ordering any drink at this bizarre church-bar, but invoking a “Bloody Mary” would cross a theological line and risk divine (or congregational) disapproval.
