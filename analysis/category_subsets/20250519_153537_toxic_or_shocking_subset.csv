The woman treats the marooned man—who sits on the miniature island inside her fishbowl—as if he were just another goldfish. Her proud phone comment echoes what people say about easy-maintenance pets: they’re cute, and when they die you simply flush them. Applying that blithe, disposable attitude to an actual, still-living human is the comic twist.

The caption shows them negotiating the fantasy: “You be the naughty mosquito, and I’ll be the tormented sporting-goods salesman.” The woman’s antennae let her plausibly play an oversized insect; the man’s helmet and the stray racket are recognizable items a sporting-goods salesman might hawk (and also things one might use to defend oneself from an insect).

A minister, whose job is to present God’s word, is standing with Satan—the ultimate opposing viewpoint—and says parishioners must “hear both sides.” Treating the Devil as if he’s just another panelist in a reasoned discussion parodies media and academic insistence that every topic deserves equal airtime, even when one side is blatantly destructive.

In a medical setting you expect the doctor to propose a costly, “invasive” surgical procedure. Instead, he offers a different kind of “non-invasive” solution: having the trench-coated tough guy behind him physically “beat it out of you.” The phrase “beat it out of you” normally means forcing someone to reveal information through violence; here it’s twisted to mean pounding an illness out of the patient.

The caption uses detective jargon (“solid lead”) and talks about the patient’s liver as if it were a stolen possession, turning a vital internal organ into a pilfered object like a wallet.

In a standard speech the first line is often, “First, I’d like to thank the board” or “First, I’d like to thank our shareholders.” Here the speaker instead thanks “the podium.” Because everyone is naked, the podium is the only thing hiding his private parts from the audience.

Through the window, however, we see the seminar’s attendees chasing a coworker with a hammer, bat, and gun—pure mayhem that is the opposite of calm mediation. The humor comes from the stark incongruity between the corporate buzzwordy phrase “conflict-resolution seminar” and the violent scene, and from the deadpan understatement of the man who treats this disaster as a routine scheduling note rather than a total failure of the training.

Because the man’s hook makes it blatantly obvious which hand was cut off, asking him to “identify” it is ridiculously unnecessary. The humor comes from this collision of solemn legal procedure with an absurdly self-evident fact, and from the dark twist that the amputation was “mistaken,” implying a lawsuit over a botched surgery. In short, it’s a formal, overly polite question about something glaringly obvious, spotlighting both bureaucratic ritual and medical malpractice in one silly moment.",PASS,"The student's answer captures the key comedic element, which is the absurdity of asking the man to identify his amputated hand when it is blatantly obvious due to the metal hook.

The woman is planning a meal for his (insect) mother the way a human hostess would for prospective in-laws. Her suggested dish—“chilled larvae in a light honey glaze”—sounds like a chic hors d’oeuvre but is really bug cuisine, fitting the mother’s species. The punch line is the word “waspy.” In ordinary conversation “WASPy” means “upper-crust, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant,” the sort of genteel taste a hostess worries about. Here it is simultaneously a literal insect joke—larvae with honey might appeal more to a wasp than to whatever species her mate is. So the caption fuses etiquette anxiety (“Will your mom think this is too fancy/pretentious?”) with insect-world menu worries, while delivering a double pun on “wasp/WASP.” The humor comes from treating interspecies food preferences and upper-class manners as the same problem.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly captures the dual meaning of ""waspy,"" touching on both the insect reference and the cultural slang for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.

","The caption tweaks the stock medical cliché “Take two aspirin and call me in the morning.” Because the patient in the drawing is absurdly oversized—only a huge hand can even fit through the doorway—the doctor inflates the dosage proportionally, prescribing “three thousand Tylenol.” The humor comes from this extreme numerical exaggeration: the doctor treats a colossal, fantastical situation with the same bland bedside manner he’d use for an everyday sniffle, merely scaling the pill count up to match the patient’s size.

Her question, “too waspy?” delivers the punch line.  

1. Literal insect meaning: The husband looks like a wasp, so larvae and honey are quite on-brand bug cuisine. She’s asking if it’s excessively wasp-like food for his wasp mother.  
2. Social meaning: In human slang, “WASP” stands for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, stereotypically associated with understated, genteel tastes. Hostesses sometimes worry a dish might be “too WASP-y.”  

The joke hinges on that double entendre. She’s simultaneously worrying about insect authenticity and referencing a human social cliché, treating exotic bug fare with the same mild culinary anxiety people have about impressing a prim suburban parent. The normal marital tone colliding with the absurd interspecies context and the pun on “waspy” creates the humor.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly discusses the dual meaning of ""waspy"" by addressing both the literal insect context and the social context related to the slang ""WASP.""

Complimenting their “empathy for victims” plays on the idea that true understanding comes from shared experience, taken to a literal extreme: to empathize, they’ve put themselves in harm’s way.
