The humor comes from the absurd inversion: the only spot that absolutely is the right time and place for emergencies is being policed for decorum like a church social.

Instead, a ragged, half-dead man has dragged himself there physically. The woman scolds him, “Would it kill you to use a few of your roaming minutes?” The joke lies in two layers: 

1) Cell-phone lingo: “roaming minutes” are the pricey minutes you use when your phone is outside its home network. People often avoid them to save money.  
2) Literal roaming: this man has truly “roamed” — he’s crawled who-knows-how-far to reach help.

The panelist absurdly prioritizes the trivial cost of cell service over the man’s obvious life-or-death need, and her phrase “Would it kill you…?” is darkly ironic because he looks as though it almost did.

Applying that blithe, disposable attitude to an actual, still-living human is the comic twist.

The caption shows them negotiating the fantasy: “You be the naughty mosquito, and I’ll be the tormented sporting-goods salesman.” The woman’s antennae let her plausibly play an oversized insect; the man’s helmet and the stray racket are recognizable items a sporting-goods salesman might hawk (and also things one might use to defend oneself from an insect).

By saying “I think the Manhattan skyline is getting suspicious,” she treats the miniature buildings inside the globe as if they were real neighbors peering in on her private life.

First, “Bloody Mary” is a popular brunch cocktail, so it fits a bar setting. But inside a church the words suddenly evoke sacred figures—the Virgin Mary and the “blood” central to Communion. Calling Mary “bloody” or requesting “blood” at the bar would sound blasphemous, even more so in the glow of stained-glass sunbeams.

The speaker (the bartender on the phone) foresees exactly that and sighs, “It’s gonna be one of those long nights of playing devil’s advocate.” 

“Playing devil’s advocate” normally means arguing the opposite side just to test an idea, but here it carries two extra layers: 
1) Because clergy are devoted to fighting the Devil, anyone who argues against them is, by definition, the “devil’s” advocate. 
2) In Catholic tradition there really was an official “Devil’s Advocate” who tried to poke holes in a candidate’s sainthood—a role priests would recognize.

So the caption melds the cliché bar-joke setup with the idiom, suggesting the bartender will spend the evening locked in head-spinning theological sparring with holy men, literally taking the Devil’s side for argument’s sake.
