The caption twists this phrase, applying it cynically to the man's own bewildering and unexpected physical state.

The phrase ""abominable"" typically refers to something terrible or unpleasant (like an awful experience). However, it is also famously used in the term ""Abominable Snowman,"" a mythical creature associated with snow and wintry environments.

Instead of finding value in traditional church activities or outreach, the speaker's ""faith-based initiative"" is simply the church providing a convenient, licensed bar, appealing to their desire for alcohol rather than spiritual or community engagement.

""Diversify among your mattresses"" is a nonsensical twist on legitimate financial advice (""diversify your investments""), combining a sophisticated term (""diversify"") with a famously insecure, old-fashioned, and simple way of hiding money (""under the mattress""). The joke is the juxtaposition of formal financial language and context with a completely unsophisticated, foolish, and paranoid strategy, implying either extreme incompetence, a desperate situation where traditional finance is distrusted, or a parody of over-complicated advice for simple actions.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly covers the anticipated answer point by discussing the concept of ""storing money in a mattress"" as a ""famously insecure, old-fashioned, and simple way of hiding money,"" which connects directly to the trope of avoiding financial institutions.

499,CS173253,,"A man stands at a podium marked “FDA,” holding a stack of papers and speaking, with an American flag behind him. Seated to his left are a man in a T-shirt who holds a drink, and a woman with crossed arms. To the right, another man in a suit is seated and looking at a sheet of paper. Behind them on the wall are framed images.","We’ve heard that laughter is the best medicine, so beginning Monday we’ll be regulating it.",This mocks the FDA's tendency to overregulate regulate medicine,"The joke hinges on taking the common idiom ""laughter is the best medicine"" completely literally. Given that the man is speaking from an FDA podium, the agency's actual role is to regulate physical drugs and medical treatments. The caption comically suggests that because laughter is *called* medicine, the FDA is now extending its regulatory authority to control this non-physical, spontaneous human experience, treating it like a pharmaceutical product. The humor comes from the absurd application of bureaucracy and government regulation to something intangible and uncontrollable like laughter, highlighting potential bureaucratic overreach or literal-mindedness within an official context like the FDA setting shown in the cartoon.",PASS,"The student’s answer explicitly addresses the comedic element by discussing how the FDA, in the context of the cartoon, would absurdly extend its regulatory powers to laughter, treating it as a physical medicine due to a literal interpretation of the idiom ""laughter is the best medicine."" This matches the anticipated answer point about the FDA's tendency to overregulate. Although the student's wording is more detailed, it captures the essence of mocking regulatory overreach.",gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17,"{""tokens_in"": 192, ""tokens_out"": 132, ""thinking_tokens"": 770, ""total_tokens"": 1094}",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 491, ""tokens_out"": 105}",20250515_201352_gemini_thinking_budget_4000_gemini_2.5_flash_preview_04_17_exp-gemini_2_5_flash_preview_04_17_ag-gpt_4o.csv
517,CC135060,,"Two elderly men, seen from behind, sit side by side at a bar lined with multiple liquor bottles. They each have a drink (in martini glasses) in front of them. Nearby, framed pictures hang on a brick-patterned wall. One man is speaking to the other","This time, when the swinging sixties come around, I'm not going to miss them.",He implies that he preferred the 1960's to the age range of 60s,"The humor lies in the contrast between the elderly men and the idea of the ""swinging sixties"" returning. The phrase ""swinging sixties"" refers to a past historical era associated with youth culture, rebellion, and hedonism. The speaker implies they somehow *missed* this era the first time around, perhaps being too conservative or cautious. The joke comes from the absurd premise that this specific, long-past decade will ""come around"" again like a season or a recurring event, giving them a second chance in their old age to finally participate in the wild activities they abstained from decades ago. It combines nostalgia, regret for missed opportunities in youth, and a humorous misunderstanding of how historical time works.",FAIL,"The student's answer focuses on the humor deriving from the idea of the ""swinging sixties"" and the absurdity of expecting them to return, which centers on nostalgia and a humorous misunderstanding of historical time. However, the anticipated answer point emphasizes the specific wordplay between the decade ""1960s"" and the men's ""60s"" age. Since the student's answer does not cover this wordplay or age-related humor, it does not address the anticipated answer point.",gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17,"{""tokens_in"": 168, ""tokens_out"": 151, ""thinking_tokens"": 492, ""total_tokens"": 811}",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 494, ""tokens_out"": 110}",20250515_201352_gemini_thinking_budget_4000_gemini_2.5_flash_preview_04_17_exp-gemini_2_5_flash_preview_04_17_ag-gpt_4o.csv
