The caption treats the church as if it’s just another tavern, warning the newcomer not to order a “Bloody Mary.” That drink name is funny here for two layered reasons. First, “Bloody Mary” is a popular brunch cocktail, so it fits a bar setting. But inside a church the words suddenly evoke sacred figures—the Virgin Mary and the “blood” central to Communion. Calling Mary “bloody” or requesting “blood” at the bar would sound blasphemous, even more so in the glow of stained-glass sunbeams.

1. “Lose your shirt” means to suffer big financial losses; the naked executives have quite literally lost their shirts.  
2. An audit is said to “expose” a company’s books; here the executives are exposed in the most literal way.  
By saying, “If all goes well, we’ll get them back after the audit,” the speaker treats clothing as something the auditors are temporarily withholding, implying that once the company passes scrutiny—or recovers financially—their shirts (and the rest of their clothes) will be returned.

The speaker (the bartender on the phone) foresees exactly that and sighs, “It’s gonna be one of those long nights of playing devil’s advocate.” 

“Playing devil’s advocate” normally means arguing the opposite side just to test an idea, but here it carries two extra layers: 
1) Because clergy are devoted to fighting the Devil, anyone who argues against them is, by definition, the “devil’s” advocate. 
2) In Catholic tradition there really was an official “Devil’s Advocate” who tried to poke holes in a candidate’s sainthood—a role priests would recognize.

So the caption melds the cliché bar-joke setup with the idiom, suggesting the bartender will spend the evening locked in head-spinning theological sparring with holy men, literally taking the Devil’s side for argument’s sake.

Scientists normally build mazes to test mice, but here the mice are in charge and are stuck putting the maze together themselves. Faced with the bewildering instructions and tiny parts, one mouse suggests a fashionable “open floor plan,” designer jargon for removing all interior walls. For mice, an “open floor plan” would mean scrapping the maze entirely—no walls, no dead ends, no tedious assembly. The joke lies in the absurd role reversal (mice as DIY decorators) and the clever shortcut: instead of suffering through maze construction and later getting lost in it, they adopt a buzzword that instantly erases the problem. It’s a neat mouse-sized echo of how humans abandon complex IKEA projects by resorting to simpler, trendier solutions.",PASS,"The student's answer captures the key comedic element by emphasizing the absurdity and humor in the mice deciding to forego the maze construction by opting for an ""open floor plan,"" which involves removing the maze walls.

The elves, depicted as overworked office staff, react nervously to an email “from Santa” that “goes way, way beyond jolly.” It suggests his message is not just cheerful but alarmingly intense—like a boss’s veiled reprimand or a massive policy overhaul. The humor comes from the contrast between Santa’s warm, festive image and the stress of modern workplace emails that promise far more than a simple holiday greeting.",FAIL,"The student's answer discusses the humor coming from a contrast between Santa's usual jolly persona and the stress-inducing email from him. However, it focuses on a corporate or workplace context and does not mention romantic advances, which is the key comedic element in the anticipated answer point. Thus, the response omits the core joke about interpreting ""beyond jolly"" as romantic advances.",o4-mini,"{""tokens_in"": 152, ""tokens_out"": 441}",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 434, ""tokens_out"": 92}",20250506_191022_o4-mini_high_exp-o4_mini_ag-gpt_4o.csv

He jokingly implies he’s going to get a second chance at “the sixties” (either his actual decade of being in his 60s or the era itself) and vows not to miss it again. The absurdity of an old man claiming he’ll relive that period is what makes it funny.",FAIL,"The student's answer discusses the pun on ""the swinging sixties"" and how it can refer to either the 1960s cultural period or the speaker's age, but does not specifically address the anticipated answer point that the humor is derived from a preference for the 1960s over being in the age range of 60s. Without explicitly capturing this preference aspect, the student’s answer lacks the specific comedic angle anticipated.",o4-mini,"{""tokens_in"": 170, ""tokens_out"": 1083}",gpt-4o,"{""tokens_in"": 458, ""tokens_out"": 102}",20250506_191022_o4-mini_high_exp-o4_mini_ag-gpt_4o.csv
