Rats are traditionally associated with being test subjects in labs, not medical professionals. The caption plays on this by having the rat-doctor reassure the patient that he self-tests prescriptions. The humor arises from two layers: 1) The literal irony of a rat ""testing on himself,"" conflating the roles of scientist and lab subject, and 2) The darkly comedic implication that the doctor’s unorthodox methods (using himself as a test subject) might be unreliable, undercutting the typical trust in medical expertise.

The humor arises from the unexpected inversion of pet ownership norms: the miniature human is treated as a disposable novelty, contrasting the nurturing tone with a darkly pragmatic punchline. The visual of a fully dressed, stern-faced ""figurine"" in a fishbowl reinforces the satire of consumer culture, where even sentient beings are reduced to temporary decor.

The cavemen, dressed in animal skins and wielding a wooden club, are framed in a scenario mimicking modern surgical theater. The third caveman’s announcement positions himself as a surgeon and the club-wielding figure as an ""anesthesiologist,"" implying the club’s purpose is to knock the patient unconscious—a primitive, violent parody of medical anesthesia.

In a courtroom, legal strategies are expected, but the lawyer’s suggestion subverts norms by implying literal escape (e.g., fleeing custody) instead of a formal appeal.

Typically, doctors urge patients to adopt healthy lifestyles immediately, framing it as urgent. Here, the patient flips the script by asking how long they can delay such changes, implying they’re resigned to eventual change but hoping to postpone it as long as possible. The humor arises from the absurdity of treating a health overhaul like an unavoidable deadline (e.g., a tax filing date), contrasting the gravity of medical advice with the patient’s nonchalant, almost bureaucratic approach to their own well-being.
