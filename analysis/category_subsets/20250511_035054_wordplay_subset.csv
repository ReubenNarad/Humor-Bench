We expect a commuter to be “late to the office because he’s stuck on the train.” In the drawing, however, the “office” is literally a conference-room table set up inside a subway car; the staff conducts meetings while riding. So when the speaker says Frank “will be late, he’s stuck at the office,” the words describe the opposite of the normal situation: Frank can’t get to the moving conference because he’s back in a conventional, stationary office.

The caption’s phrase “constant monitoring” thus gains a second, literal meaning: the rash won’t just be watched by the patient or doctor; it already has its own round-the-clock surveillance agent.

By placing a suited office worker in the unmistakably pregnant pose and having him treat it like an ordinary medical pregnancy (“The ultrasound says…”), the caption fuses two incompatible ideas: masculine beer-drinking bloat and obstetric procedure. Instead of announcing a baby’s sex or due date, the “expectant father” reports that the scan revealed a keg of Bud Light—the very cause of his swollen abdomen.

The caption treats the church as if it’s just another tavern, warning the newcomer not to order a “Bloody Mary.” That drink name is funny here for two layered reasons. First, “Bloody Mary” is a popular brunch cocktail, so it fits a bar setting. But inside a church the words suddenly evoke sacred figures—the Virgin Mary and the “blood” central to Communion. Calling Mary “bloody” or requesting “blood” at the bar would sound blasphemous, even more so in the glow of stained-glass sunbeams.

The speaker (the bartender on the phone) foresees exactly that and sighs, “It’s gonna be one of those long nights of playing devil’s advocate.” 

“Playing devil’s advocate” normally means arguing the opposite side just to test an idea, but here it carries two extra layers: 
1) Because clergy are devoted to fighting the Devil, anyone who argues against them is, by definition, the “devil’s” advocate. 
2) In Catholic tradition there really was an official “Devil’s Advocate” who tried to poke holes in a candidate’s sainthood—a role priests would recognize.

So the caption melds the cliché bar-joke setup with the idiom, suggesting the bartender will spend the evening locked in head-spinning theological sparring with holy men, literally taking the Devil’s side for argument’s sake.

The scene is set in a prehistoric landscape with mountains in the background. The caveman is speaking to the family.",Rare? It's nearly extinct.,"This plays on the word ""rare,"" which can mean undercooked or uncommon","The punch line hinges on two different meanings of the word “rare.”  
1. At a cook-out “rare” is a degree of doneness—meat that’s only lightly cooked.  
2. “Rare” also means scarce or hard to find, the step just before “extinct.”  

In the cartoon, a family member has evidently asked the caveman whether the giant hunk of meat will be served “rare.” He answers, “Rare? It’s nearly extinct.” Instead of talking about how much he has cooked the steak, he pretends they were asking about the animal’s place on the evolutionary timeline. Because this is the Stone Age, the meat might indeed come from a species that’s about to disappear (mammoth, dinosaur, etc.).  

The humor comes from the caveman conflating the culinary term with the zoological one: jumping from a simple grill request to the grand, prehistoric notion of extinction. The absurdly large slab of meat and the setting reinforce the idea that the animal is one of those doomed, long-gone creatures, making the deadpan reply both a pun and an anachronistic “foodie” joke.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly covers the anticipated answer point by highlighting the dual meaning of the word ""rare"" and explaining how it is used in a pun within the cartoon.

How does the saying go again?,"""Don't put the cart before the horse"" is an idiom about doing things in the right order","The normal way to move a cart is to hitch the horse in front and have it pull. But here the first horse is literally in front of the cart, leaning backward and pushing it, while the second horse observes. That visual turns the familiar idiom “putting the cart before the horse” into a sight gag: the horses themselves have gotten the sequence wrong. The spoken line—“Hang on… We must be doing something wrong… How does the saying go again?”—acknowledges that they sense a famous proverb applies but can’t quite remember it. The humor comes from animals embodying a cliché so literally that they’re confused about the cliché itself, highlighting the absurd reversal of the usual order and giving the idiom a punny, physical punch line.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly addresses the idiom ""putting the cart before the horse,"" explaining how the cartoon uses a literal depiction of it to create humor.

The speaker delivers the standard boardroom complaint that “idea-sharing isn’t working,” oblivious to—or resigned about—the ridiculous apparatus built precisely for that purpose. The humor comes from the contrast between the elaborate, sci-fi gear and the mundane corporate cliché: even when their brains are wired together, office brainstorming still produces nothing useful. It satirizes business culture’s faith in gimmicks and jargon while highlighting how collaboration can fail despite (or because of) overengineered solutions.",PASS,"The student's answer effectively captures the key element by illustrating that the humor arises from the literal interpretation of ""idea-sharing"" through helmets that physically link the executives.

On the desk are a notepad, pens, a telephone keypad, and a framed photo.",Can I call you back? I’m with a piece of string.,"This mimics the phrase, ""I'm with a client,"" implying the cat's job is to play with the string","The line mimics a standard business excuse ­– “Can I call you back? I’m with a client.”  But the caller is an office-dwelling cat, and instead of giving his attention to an important person, he’s occupied by the quintessential feline toy: a piece of string lying on his desk. The joke comes from blending two incompatible worlds: formal corporate phone talk and a cat’s primal, playful obsession. The deadpan substitution of “piece of string” for “client” exposes how absurd it is for a supposedly serious executive to prioritize cat play, while the cat’s human setting makes the substitution feel matter-of-fact. The contrast between executive professionalism and quintessential cat behavior creates the humor.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly discusses the mimicry of the phrase ""I'm with a client"" and makes it clear that the humor stems from the substitution of ""piece of string"" for ""client,"" showcasing the absurdity of a business cat prioritizing the toy.

In the drawing, however, a worker is physically lugging a conference-room chair down the hall. The caption makes it sound as though the other man is asking the usual figurative question, but the picture shows that this guy has taken the phrase literally: instead of abstract conclusions, he actually “took away” a piece of furniture from the meeting. The clash between the expected metaphorical meaning and the absurdly literal interpretation creates the humor.",PASS,"The student's answer effectively captures the comedic device of the literal interpretation of a figurative phrase. The student describes how the phrase ""take away"" is typically metaphorical in a business context, and humor arises from the absurdity of its literal application as depicted by the man's action of carrying away the chair.

For cats, “the box” is the litter box; “thinking outside” it would mean relieving itself on the carpet. The humor comes from fusing office motivational jargon with pet-owner scolding: a lofty metaphor about innovation is reduced to a literal rule about where to poop.

The drawing shows a man in pajamas at his bedside phone, so the literal interpretation is set up—he’s either giving or getting a routine early-morning call. The caption then delivers the figurative meaning in its most extreme form: “change or die.” By having a supposedly courteous hotel wake-up call come with a melodramatic, life-or-death ultimatum, the caption mashes the mundane and the dire.
