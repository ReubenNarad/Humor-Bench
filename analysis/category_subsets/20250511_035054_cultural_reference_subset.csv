A minister, whose job is to present God’s word, is standing with Satan—the ultimate opposing viewpoint—and says parishioners must “hear both sides.” Treating the Devil as if he’s just another panelist in a reasoned discussion parodies media and academic insistence that every topic deserves equal airtime, even when one side is blatantly destructive. The absurd equivalence between holy teaching and literal evil creates the comic incongruity.",PASS,"The student's answer captures the anticipated answer point by discussing the irony of treating the Devil as just another perspective in a reasoned discussion, akin to the ""both-sides"" debate approach.

The other butterfly treats this as an odd but not unprecedented mutation, joking that it has a sibling who resembles a soup can—an allusion to Andy Warhol’s iconic Campbell’s-soup-can art. The humor comes from mixing high-art references with the natural world and from the escalation: if a Mondrian-winged butterfly is strange, a butterfly shaped like a Warhol soup can is even more absurd.

The caption pushes that mash-up further by swapping standard business lingo (“revenues are down this quarter”) with pirate vocabulary (“booty”). The speaker defends himself exactly the way a modern executive would in a quarterly earnings meeting, but he’s talking about plunder. The laugh comes from the incongruity of treating piratical treasure like a line item on a financial report and from hearing a suit-and-tie professional use the word “booty” with total seriousness.",PASS,"The student's answer captures the key comedic element of blending corporate and pirate worlds through the parrots and the use of ""booty"" instead of typical corporate jargon.

Here the disappearing lover happens to be a vampire, who, like many stereotypical cads, is throwing on his “cape” and heading for the door before dawn. The woman bitterly compares her situation to that of another classic movie monster couple, the Bride of Frankenstein and Frankenstein’s monster, assuming that even a sewn-together corpse manages some post-romantic snuggling.

The pregnant man is speaking, seemingly addressing the other with a comment.",No one expects an immaculate conception until it happens to him.,The immaculate conception involved a virgin inexplicably getting pregnant. This caption plays on that to explain the man's inexplicable pregnancy.,"The humor hinges on an impossible reversal and a religious allusion. A visibly pregnant man—something biologically impossible—claims his condition is the result of an “immaculate conception,” the term Christians use for Mary’s miraculous, sex-free pregnancy. The familiar phrase “No one expects ­­­X until it happens to them” is tweaked to “him,” underscoring the absurdity that a man could face pregnancy at all. The line justifies the impossible situation with an equally unlikely miracle, blending office small-talk with biblical mythology.

The woman is speaking.","Well, that was abominable.","This plays on the phrase ""abominable snowman,"" a mythical creature","The humor hinges on a double meaning of “abominable.” In everyday speech it means “awful,” so the woman, apparently just after an intimate encounter, is bluntly criticizing how bad it was. But “Abominable” instantly evokes the “Abominable Snowman,” a mythical snowy creature. Because there is an oversized snow globe containing a snowman right beside her in bed, the reader is led to imagine that this snowman was her improbable partner.

The caption treats the church as if it’s just another tavern, warning the newcomer not to order a “Bloody Mary.” That drink name is funny here for two layered reasons. First, “Bloody Mary” is a popular brunch cocktail, so it fits a bar setting. But inside a church the words suddenly evoke sacred figures—the Virgin Mary and the “blood” central to Communion. Calling Mary “bloody” or requesting “blood” at the bar would sound blasphemous, even more so in the glow of stained-glass sunbeams. The humor lies in this double meaning: a perfectly ordinary drink order becomes a potentially sacrilegious faux-pas when the bar is bizarrely located in a sanctuary.",FAIL,"The student's answer primarily focuses on the juxtaposition of a church and a bar, emphasizing the potential sacrilegious nature of ordering a ""Bloody Mary"" in a church. However, the anticipated answer point specifically requires the dual meaning to include the ghost of Mary I of England, which is not addressed in the student's response.

Bush's ""Faith-Based and Community Initiatives,"" a program that funds cetrain faith-based organizations","The scene mashes together two normally separate worlds: a lofty church sanctuary and a full-on cocktail bar. The husband borrows the Washington buzz-phrase “faith-based initiative,” coined for government programs that support religious charities, and applies it to this boozy set-up. His line means “At last—a religious project I can actually get behind,” implying he’s usually unenthusiastic about organized religion, but enthusiastic about drinking. The humor comes from the clash between sacred and profane (stained-glass shafts of light sanctifying bottles of liquor) and from repurposing a solemn policy term to describe something that panders to earthly appetites. It’s also a sly play on “embrace” and “spirits”: these “spirits” are alcoholic, not holy.",PASS,"The student's answer accurately recognizes the use of the term ""faith-based initiative,"" relating it to the concept of repurposing a Washington buzz-phrase for comedic effect.

The caption plays on the double meaning of “sending me jokes”––normally it means e-mailing or telling jokes, but here it’s taken literally: the caller has physically dispatched the joke’s cast to the bartender’s place of employment. The collision between everyday workplace frustration and the surreal manifestation of a stock joke set-up creates the comic twist.",PASS,"The student's answer effectively explains the classic joke setup involving a priest, a minister, and a rabbi walking into a bar and links it to the cartoon's depiction.

The caption—“Stop me if you’ve heard this one”—is the stock phrase a joke-teller uses before launching into a well-worn gag. Here it’s comically misplaced: the “joke” isn’t being told; it’s visibly unfolding in real life.

By framing the household of “the Samsas” like any other humdrum suburban couple, the caption deflates Kafka’s nightmarish scenario and turns it into sitcom banality, producing comic incongruity.",PASS,"The student's answer does explicitly cover the anticipated answer point by discussing how the routine domestic behavior is contrasted with the surreal scenario of living with a gigantic insect.

The woman is planning a meal for his (insect) mother the way a human hostess would for prospective in-laws. Her suggested dish—“chilled larvae in a light honey glaze”—sounds like a chic hors d’oeuvre but is really bug cuisine, fitting the mother’s species. The punch line is the word “waspy.” In ordinary conversation “WASPy” means “upper-crust, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant,” the sort of genteel taste a hostess worries about. Here it is simultaneously a literal insect joke—larvae with honey might appeal more to a wasp than to whatever species her mate is. So the caption fuses etiquette anxiety (“Will your mom think this is too fancy/pretentious?”) with insect-world menu worries, while delivering a double pun on “wasp/WASP.” The humor comes from treating interspecies food preferences and upper-class manners as the same problem.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly captures the dual meaning of ""waspy,"" touching on both the insect reference and the cultural slang for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.

In the drawing, the fish isn’t just singing—it’s clamped onto the man’s hand. He explains that, although the bite hurts, it’s worth it to shut the fish up before it launches into that song yet again. The humor comes from 1) recognizing the over-familiar, mildly annoying gag gift, 2) exaggerating how far someone would go to silence it (allowing himself to be physically attacked), and 3) the incongruity of a taxidermy-style trophy acting like an aggressive, living jukebox.

Calling the Almighty “Mr. Wonderful” is a sarcastic understatement, and labeling the Fall of Man as just “one of his episodes” shrinks a cosmic act of judgment to the level of garden-variety moodiness.

The speaker—clearly long past his own 60s—treats the phrase like a bus that will circle back: next time it’s the 2060s (or when he again reaches his sixties in age!), he vows to join the fun he once missed. The humor comes from that double meaning. To listeners his promise is absurd: neither the cultural moment nor his own sixth decade will ever return, and someone this old is unlikely to become a free-loving swinger now.
