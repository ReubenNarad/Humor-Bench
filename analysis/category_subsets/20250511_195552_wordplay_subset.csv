We expect a commuter to be “late to the office because he’s stuck on the train.” In the drawing, however, the “office” is literally a conference-room table set up inside a subway car; the staff conducts meetings while riding. So when the speaker says Frank “will be late, he’s stuck at the office,” the words describe the opposite of the normal situation: Frank can’t get to the moving conference because he’s back in a conventional, stationary office.

The caption’s phrase “constant monitoring” thus gains a second, literal meaning: the rash won’t just be watched by the patient or doctor; it already has its own round-the-clock surveillance agent.

By placing a suited office worker in the unmistakably pregnant pose and having him treat it like an ordinary medical pregnancy (“The ultrasound says…”), the caption fuses two incompatible ideas: masculine beer-drinking bloat and obstetric procedure. Instead of announcing a baby’s sex or due date, the “expectant father” reports that the scan revealed a keg of Bud Light—the very cause of his swollen abdomen.

The caption treats the church as if it’s just another tavern, warning the newcomer not to order a “Bloody Mary.” That drink name is funny here for two layered reasons. First, “Bloody Mary” is a popular brunch cocktail, so it fits a bar setting. But inside a church the words suddenly evoke sacred figures—the Virgin Mary and the “blood” central to Communion. Calling Mary “bloody” or requesting “blood” at the bar would sound blasphemous, even more so in the glow of stained-glass sunbeams.

The speaker (the bartender on the phone) foresees exactly that and sighs, “It’s gonna be one of those long nights of playing devil’s advocate.” 

“Playing devil’s advocate” normally means arguing the opposite side just to test an idea, but here it carries two extra layers: 
1) Because clergy are devoted to fighting the Devil, anyone who argues against them is, by definition, the “devil’s” advocate. 
2) In Catholic tradition there really was an official “Devil’s Advocate” who tried to poke holes in a candidate’s sainthood—a role priests would recognize.

So the caption melds the cliché bar-joke setup with the idiom, suggesting the bartender will spend the evening locked in head-spinning theological sparring with holy men, literally taking the Devil’s side for argument’s sake.

The scene is set in a prehistoric landscape with mountains in the background. The caveman is speaking to the family.",Rare? It's nearly extinct.,"This plays on the word ""rare,"" which can mean undercooked or uncommon","The punch line hinges on two different meanings of the word “rare.”  
1. At a cook-out “rare” is a degree of doneness—meat that’s only lightly cooked.  
2. “Rare” also means scarce or hard to find, the step just before “extinct.”  

In the cartoon, a family member has evidently asked the caveman whether the giant hunk of meat will be served “rare.” He answers, “Rare? It’s nearly extinct.” Instead of talking about how much he has cooked the steak, he pretends they were asking about the animal’s place on the evolutionary timeline. Because this is the Stone Age, the meat might indeed come from a species that’s about to disappear (mammoth, dinosaur, etc.).  

The humor comes from the caveman conflating the culinary term with the zoological one: jumping from a simple grill request to the grand, prehistoric notion of extinction. The absurdly large slab of meat and the setting reinforce the idea that the animal is one of those doomed, long-gone creatures, making the deadpan reply both a pun and an anachronistic “foodie” joke.",PASS,"The student's answer explicitly covers the anticipated answer point by highlighting the dual meaning of the word ""rare"" and explaining how it is used in a pun within the cartoon.
