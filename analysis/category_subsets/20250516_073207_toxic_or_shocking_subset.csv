The caption ""Neither the time nor the place, Doug!"" is something you'd say to someone telling an inappropriate joke or story, completely trivializing the man's apparent plight (crawling, disheveled).

The caption starts sweetly, like someone describing a cute new pet (the fish/man). However, it pivots abruptly to a chillingly casual suggestion of disposal (""flush him down the toilet""), which is a common, albeit crude, way people sometimes get rid of unwanted pet fish.

The caption subverts the expected medical advice (explaining a procedure) and replaces it with a threat of physical violence, delivered by the presumably non-medical figure.

This caption plays on that to explain the man's inexplicable pregnancy.,"The humor comes from the juxtaposition of the extraordinary, unexpected event (a man becoming pregnant) with the phrase ""immaculate conception,"" typically associated with a miraculous and specific religious context (the conception of Jesus without original sin). The caption twists this phrase, applying it cynically to the man's own bewildering and unexpected physical state. The joke is the deadpan application of a concept usually reserved for religious miracle to a very secular and physically impossible (under normal biological understanding) office scenario, implying his pregnancy is just as inexplicable to him as a religious miracle, and nobody believes in such things until *they* are the impossible exception.",PASS,"The student's answer captures the key comedic element by discussing the use of ""immaculate conception"" as a twist applied to the man's surprising and unexplainable pregnancy.

The phrase ""abominable"" typically refers to something terrible or unpleasant (like an awful experience). However, it is also famously used in the term ""Abominable Snowman,"" a mythical creature associated with snow and wintry environments.

The humor in the caption arises from the juxtaposition of the sacred setting (""church,"" implied by the formal attire of the couple, the architecture, stained glass, and dramatic lighting) with the secular/profane activity (drinking at a bar). The specific joke in the caption, ""Just don't order a Bloody Mary,"" plays on the double meaning of ""Bloody Mary."" In the context of a bar, it's a common cocktail. In a religious context, the term ""bloody"" associated with ""Mary"" (the mother of Jesus) would be considered sacrilegious or highly inappropriate, referencing suffering or potentially blasphemy. The humor comes from this taboo collision of concepts within the bizarre church-bar setting.",PASS,"The student's answer captures the key comedic element of the play on the dual meaning of ""Bloody Mary.""
