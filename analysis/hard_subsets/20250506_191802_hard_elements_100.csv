The suit, with its rigid metal helmet and thick layers, obviously makes physical intimacy almost impossible, so she matter-of-factly concedes, “We don’t have much of a sex life.” The punch line is the absurd “trade-off” she offers: despite the huge relationship deficit, his sole selling point is that he’s handy at retrieving lost keys from a pool—an insignificantly rare need.

The caption treats this absurd sight with dead-serious corporate jargon, as though “the bunny division” were a legitimate department that just got downsized. By speaking of “laying off” rabbits the same way one would talk about, say, the accounting department, the caption fuses mundane business talk with something patently ridiculous.

But the woman’s bedfellow is a giant snow-globe containing a snowman and the tiny Manhattan skyline that usually decorates such globes.  By saying “I think the Manhattan skyline is getting suspicious,” she treats the miniature buildings inside the globe as if they were real neighbors peering in on her private life. The humor comes from: 1) the absurdity of a human having an intimate night with a novelty snow-globe, and 2) the anthropomorphism of an inanimate, toy-sized city “watching” and judging her, parodying the way city dwellers worry about curious onlookers in nearby apartments. The caption transfers a familiar urban anxiety to an impossible, miniature audience inside a novelty object, creating a surreal, self-aware joke.",FAIL,"The student's answer focuses on the anthropomorphic and surreal aspects of the cartoon rather than the cheating implication, which is the anticipated answer point.

The caption treats the church as if it’s just another tavern, warning the newcomer not to order a “Bloody Mary.” That drink name is funny here for two layered reasons. First, “Bloody Mary” is a popular brunch cocktail, so it fits a bar setting. But inside a church the words suddenly evoke sacred figures—the Virgin Mary and the “blood” central to Communion. Calling Mary “bloody” or requesting “blood” at the bar would sound blasphemous, even more so in the glow of stained-glass sunbeams.

The husband borrows the Washington buzz-phrase “faith-based initiative,” coined for government programs that support religious charities, and applies it to this boozy set-up. His line means “At last—a religious project I can actually get behind,” implying he’s usually unenthusiastic about organized religion, but enthusiastic about drinking. The humor comes from the clash between sacred and profane (stained-glass shafts of light sanctifying bottles of liquor) and from repurposing a solemn policy term to describe something that panders to earthly appetites. It’s also a sly play on “embrace” and “spirits”: these “spirits” are alcoholic, not holy.",PASS,"The student's answer accurately recognizes the use of the term ""faith-based initiative,"" relating it to the concept of repurposing a Washington buzz-phrase for comedic effect.

2. An audit is said to “expose” a company’s books; here the executives are exposed in the most literal way.  
By saying, “If all goes well, we’ll get them back after the audit,” the speaker treats clothing as something the auditors are temporarily withholding, implying that once the company passes scrutiny—or recovers financially—their shirts (and the rest of their clothes) will be returned. The humor comes from turning figurative corporate language into a physical sight gag.",PASS,"The student’s answer explicitly discusses the nudity of the board members in the context of financial idioms related to loss and exposure, which connect to the idea of “transparency” during an audit.

Second, the doctor uses the word “jolly,” a descriptor commonly attached to outsized fictional figures (Santa Claus, the Jolly Green Giant). He then undercuts that cheery image with a very ordinary, un-jolly medical scolding: “your cholesterol is through the roof.” The humor comes from the mismatch between the patient’s exaggerated, storybook scale and the mundane health problem, and from the doctor’s deadpan suggestion that high cholesterol ought to wipe the smile off even a mythically jolly character’s face.",FAIL,"The student's answer does not explicitly mention the pun or play on words involving ""through the roof.""

The understatement of the doctor’s remark clashes absurdly with the grotesque severity of the patient’s state, creating comic incongruity. In addition, “keep an eye on it” carries a wry literal twist, because the patient’s actual eyes are detached along with his head; “keeping an eye” on anything is itself problematic.

Humor hinges on two word-play layers:

1. “Jolly” is a stereotype for oversized characters (Santa Claus, the Jolly Green Giant, etc.).  The single gigantic hand cues us to picture that kind of big, happy figure waiting outside the door.  

2. The phrase “through the roof” is a routine medical cliché for a dangerously high lab value, but here it also literalizes the patient’s immensity: the patient is so big he already had to stick his hand through the doorway and would indeed go “through the roof.”

The caption flips that meaning on its head. The agent pedantically claims that the million-dollar “umbrella policy” protects the client only in accidents that literally involve an umbrella (slipping on one, poking someone with it, etc.). By interpreting the industry term in its narrowest, literal sense, he turns what should be generous coverage into something absurdly useless. The humor comes from:  
1. Wordplay: treating a figurative phrase as if it were literal.  
2. Satire of insurance fine print—suggesting insurers will redefine words to avoid paying claims.
