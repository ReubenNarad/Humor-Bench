1,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","This is my stop. Phil, you'll be CEO til 63rd street.","The caption implies that because this business meets on public transit, their leadership is determined by who is currently riding","This caption juxtaposes a formal business meeting environment with the informal and transient setting of public transportation. The humor arises from the absurdity of treating a temporary stop on a subway or bus route as a significant transition in corporate leadership. It's funny because the statement treats the resignation and appointment of a CEO like a short, casual task that can happen as quickly as someone getting off at a bus stop, thereby trivializing what is typically a significant and serious decision. The idea of a rotating CEO position based solely on when someone physically leaves their seat is both unexpected and playful, highlighting the incongruity between the business world and public commuting.",gpt-4o,openai,
2,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","Yes, I do miss the corporate jet. I miss the corporate jet very much.",This implies that holding meetings on public transit is a downgrade for the organization,"The humor in this caption lies in the contrast between the expected luxury of corporate travel and the mundane reality depicted in the cartoon. Typically, high-ranking business executives are associated with opulent travel options, such as a corporate jet, which signifies success and wealth. The juxtaposition of this luxury with the setting of a cramped, public mode of transport like a bus or subway creates an amusing discrepancy. The speaker's statement underscores this contrast; they're expressing nostalgia for the extravagant corporate jet while obviously in a much less glamorous situation. The serious tone of the statement adds to the humor by highlighting the absurdity of having a business meeting in such an incongruous and inconvenient location. This displacement from a corporate jet to public transit emphasizes the fall from high status to a far more relatable, everyday experience, creating comedic effect.",gpt-4o,openai,
3,,2.0,"A group of adults dressed in business attire are seated around a table in a meeting. However, the scene is inside of a bus or subway car, with handles and windows. The person at the head of the table is speaking.","Frank called to say he'll be late, he's stuck at the office.",This is specifically a wordplay reversing the more common phrase “being late to the office while stuck in transit”.,"This caption plays on the incongruity between the setting and the situation described. Typically, meetings are held in an office environment, not in public transportation, which creates an unusual and humorous scenario where a meeting is happening inside a bus or subway car. The humor arises from the punchline that Frank is ""stuck at the office,"" suggesting that the office is somewhere distant or inaccessible, highlighting the absurdity of the mix-up between traditional office meeting spaces and the unexpected transit setting portrayed in the cartoon.",gpt-4o,openai,
4,,3.0,"4 people in fancy attire sit behind a desk wearing gooseneck microphones, possibly in a game show or telethon. Behind them is a sign that reads in bold text ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE"". In front of them, a discheveled man in tattered clothes is crawling, looking up at them. The hosts are looking at the man with flat expressions. One host in the middle, a woman, leans over the desk with both hands, yelling angrily at the man crawling on the ground.",This better be good. That floor was waxed last night!,"The woman's callous attitude towards the man in need contradicts what we expect from an emergency hotline worker, who typically aims to be helpful","The humor in this caption comes from the juxtaposition of the grim situation and the trivial complaint made by the host. The cartoon sets up an expectation of seriousness and urgency, as suggested by the term ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE"" and the appearance of a man seemingly in distress. Typically, one might expect the hosts to respond with concern and readiness to help. However, instead of addressing the man's apparent need for assistance, the host dismisses the situation by focusing on the inconvenience of having a recently waxed floor potentially being scuffed. This unexpected shift to triviality in the face of an emergency creates an absurd and humorous contrast, as the focus is placed on something entirely unrelated to the man's probable urgent need for help.",gpt-4o,openai,

In front of them, a discheveled man in tattered clothes is crawling, looking up at them. The hosts are looking at the man with flat expressions. One host in the middle, a woman, leans over the desk with both hands, yelling angrily at the man crawling on the ground.","Neither the time nor the place, Doug!","Typically, the emergency hotline is exactly the time and place for a person in need of help.","The humor in this caption arises from the incongruous clash between the dire, dramatic situation that appears to unfold, and the socially oblivious response it receives. The cartoon depicts a ""hotline"" meant for emergencies, suggesting a legitimate crisis is occurring with the disheveled man in distress. However, the woman’s scolding response, ""Neither the time nor the place, Doug!"" humorously undermines the gravity of the scene by treating it as an inappropriate disruption akin to a social faux pas. This punchline contrasts the expectation where such an ""emergency hotline"" would ideally be the perfect place and time. Instead, we witness an indifferent, almost dismissive reaction that comically mimics the tone of someone chiding a friend for an inappropriate remark at a dinner party. Such juxtaposition highlights the absurdity inherent in the scenario, thereby creating a humorous effect.",gpt-4o,openai,

The cartoon depicts an ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE,"" where one might expect urgent assistance, yet the caption has the woman angrily scold the disheveled man as if he is merely inconveniencing them by appearing in person. The punchline suggests that, despite the man's apparent dire situation, he should have simply used ""roaming minutes"" from a mobile phone plan to call them instead. This creates a humorous and absurd image by trivializing the man's urgent need for help and satirizing how technology and trivial social expectations can remove practical human interaction or empathy in urgent scenarios.",gpt-4o,openai,
7,,7.0,"In a bedroom, a couple is in bed. The wife is sitting upright, while the husband who is speaking is laying down. Next to the bed is a nightstand under a window. Through the window is a view of outer space, with all of Earth visible. The window is open with the curtains drawn.",It's just the wind.,This is a play on words on the dual meaning of wind to mean either typical wind or solar wind.,"The humor in this caption stems from the juxtaposition between the mundanity of the husband's comment and the extraordinary view out the window. In a typical setting, someone might reassure their partner by attributing a noise to ""just the wind,"" a common explanation for minor disturbances. However, in this cartoon, the open window revealing all of Earth and outer space implies that they are not on Earth at all, suggesting they are in outer space or on a space station. The husband's nonchalant explanation minimizes the improbability and grandiosity of the situation, creating a comedic contrast between his calm demeanor and the bizarre, implausible scenario outside their window.",gpt-4o,openai,
8,,7.0,"In a bedroom, a couple is in bed. The wife is sitting upright, while the husband who is speaking is laying down. Next to the bed is a nightstand under a window. Through the window is a view of outer space, with all of Earth visible. The window is open with the curtains drawn.",You always get like this when there's a full Earth.,"This caption reverses the idea of a ""full moon"" with a ""full earth""","The humor in the caption arises from the clever reversal of the common phrase, ""full moon,"" which is often associated with changes in behavior, such as werewolves transforming or people acting oddly. In this cartoon, the setting is unexpectedly in outer space, where Earth, not the Moon, is visible from the window. By stating ""full Earth"" instead of ""full moon,"" the caption humorously applies this trope to a cosmic perspective, implying that the husband's change in behavior is due to the 'full' planet. This incongruity and role reversal elicit amusement by prompting readers to imagine comedic consequences when familiar expressions are humorously adapted to an unconventional outer space scenario.",gpt-4o,openai,
9,,7.0,"In a bedroom, a couple is in bed. The wife is sitting upright, while the husband who is speaking is laying down. Next to the bed is a nightstand under a window. Through the window is a view of outer space, with all of Earth visible. The window is open with the curtains drawn.","Relax, honey—everybody gets buyer's remorse","This caption gives the cartoon a backstory, acknowledging that outer space is an odd location for a house and implying that the woman is not entirely satisfied with it. ","This cartoon plays on the cliché of ""buyer's remorse,"" which is the regret one might feel after making a significant purchase. Here, the humor derives from the idea that the couple has bought something as extravagant and large-scale as Earth itself. The juxtaposition of such an immense purchase with the domestic setting of a couple in bed suggests the absurdity of someone casually buying an entire planet, making the husband's remark humorous. The cartoon creates a hyperbolic scenario where the husband's reassurance about a universal feeling of regret becomes comically exaggerated given the context of owning Earth. The open window showing the planet reinforces the absurdity and exaggerates the typical domestic context of such a conversation.",gpt-4o,openai,
10,,8.0,"A woman is speaking on the phone, smiling while looking into a fish bowl. Inside the fishbowl are three fish, as well as a miniature desert island with two little palm trees. On the island, a tiny bald man in glasses is sitting with a straight face, his hands on his knees.",We decided on separate vacations this year.,"This likens the fishbowl island to a beach resort, implying that the man is on vacation.","The humor in the caption arises from the juxtaposition of a familiar human experience—deciding on separate vacations—with a fantastical and absurd situation involving a tiny man living inside a fishbowl. The woman's comment suggests that she's on the phone discussing her holiday plans, implying that her companion (the tiny man) has chosen to vacation separately on his own little island inside the fishbowl. This plays on the classic ""desert island"" trope, and the absurdity of a miniature vacation spot in a fishbowl adds an element of whimsy. The humor is further enhanced by the straight-faced demeanor of the tiny man, which contrasts with the unconventional vacation setting. Overall, the caption cleverly blends reality with surrealism, creating a comical scene by bringing an everyday decision into an extraordinary context.",gpt-4o,openai,
11,,8.0,"A woman is speaking on the phone, smiling while looking into a fish bowl. Inside the fishbowl are three fish, as well as a miniature desert island with two little palm trees. On the island, a tiny bald man in glasses is sitting with a straight face, his hands on his knees.","He's the cutest little thing, and when you get tired of him you just flush him down the toilet",The woman is talking about the man as if he's a pet fish,"The humor in this caption arises from the unexpected juxtaposition of a fishbowl, typically home to small pets like fish, with a miniature desert island occupied by a tiny man. Initially depicted as an adorably humorous scenario, the caption quickly subverts this cuteness by suggesting a callous and absurdly casual attitude towards ""disposing"" of the tiny man by flushing him down the toilet, as one might with a small fish. This combination of a surreal visual element and a darkly humorous punchline plays on the absurdity and perceived disposability of both the tiny man and small pets, creating a comically twisted, unexpected perspective that evokes laughter through surprise and exaggeration.",gpt-4o,openai,
12,,8.0,"A woman is speaking on the phone, smiling while looking into a fish bowl. Inside the fishbowl are three fish, as well as a miniature desert island with two little palm trees. On the island, a tiny bald man in glasses is sitting with a straight face, his hands on his knees.",You wouldn't believe it! I met a man at the pet store.,"This subverts the typical meaning of the phrase. Typically, this would mean that she met a normal man as a potential dating partner, but here, she purchased him as a pet.","The humor in the caption lies in the absurdity and surprise of the situation. The woman on the phone mentions meeting a man at the pet store, leading the listener to assume she is talking about a human encounter. However, the punchline reveals that the ""man"" she met is actually the tiny figure on the desert island inside the fishbowl. The juxtaposition of a tiny human figure in a typically animal habitat and the woman's casual mention of this interaction plays with expectations, creating a whimsical and amusing scenario that upends the normal convention of what is found in a fishbowl or encountered at a pet store.",gpt-4o,openai,
13,,13.0,"In an intimate bedroomsetting, a couple is in bed. The man is lying back on his helbows, while the woman is straddling him in a nightdress. However, the woman is wearing an antenna headband from a costume, the man is wearing a full-faced football helmet, and a tennis racket lies next to them on the bed. The woman's eyebrows are slightly furrowed.","Okay. Now you be the naughty mosquito, and I'll be the tormented sporting goods salesman.",The caption attempts to explain the collection of goods as a sexual roleplay,"The humor in this caption emerges from the absurd role-playing scenario it describes. In the intimate setting of a bedroom, the expectation is typically romantic or serious conversation. However, the couple is engaged in a comical and bizarre role-playing game, with the woman acting as a 'naughty mosquito' and the man as a 'tormented sporting goods salesman.' The setup is intentionally ridiculous, enhanced by the incongruous props: the woman's antenna headband, the man's football helmet, and the tennis racket. These items are humorously tied into the mosquito theme, suggesting the racket could be used to 'swat' the mosquito, while the helmet might be protective gear for the 'salesman.' This unexpected and whimsical scenario creates humor by deviating from typical bedroom activities and highlighting the couple's imaginative, playful dynamic.",gpt-4o,openai,

The woman's eyebrows are slightly furrowed.",I think we need a new sex therapist,This caption suggests that the odd situation is the result of an unusual sexual roleplay.,"The humor in this caption stems from the absurdity and incongruity of the couple's attire and props in an intimate setting, suggesting that their approach to rekindling romance or improving their sex life is unusual and ineffective. The woman's slightly furrowed brows imply dissatisfaction or confusion, which aligns with the verbal punchline: ""I think we need a new sex therapist."" This suggests that their current therapist has guided them to engage in these bizarre activities or costumes as a form of therapy. The punchline humorously highlights their failure to achieve the desired intimacy, as indicated by the mismatched objects like the antenna headband, football helmet, and tennis racket. The ridiculousness of these items contrasts sharply with the conventional atmosphere of a bedroom, creating comedic tension and highlighting the inadequacy of their current therapeutic advice.",gpt-4o,openai,
16,,15.0,"In a restaurant, a man and a woman are sitting down to eat dressed in nice clothing. The man is leaning over the table with his hand on a glass looking at the woman with a soft smile. However, the man is bald, and has a cartoonishly large forehead, with the outline of the woman visible on his forehead. The woman, siting upright, is speaking.",Don't move. I think I have something in my teeth.,"This implies that the outline of the woman is her reflection, and that she's using the man's bald head as a mirror. ","The humor in this caption lies in the play on the concept of reflection. Typically, when someone mentions they have something in their teeth, the natural response is to check their reflection in a mirror or any reflective surface, like a glass. However, in this cartoon, the man's unusually large and shiny bald forehead humorously replaces the traditional reflective object. The joke is furthered by the absurdity of the woman's serious request for him not to move, as if his forehead is a perfectly viable and practical mirror in a formal dining setting. This unexpected twist and exaggeration make the situation amusingly illogical, while maintaining a relatable element of self-consciousness about one's appearance.",gpt-4o,openai,
17,,15.0,"In a restaurant, a man and a woman are sitting down to eat dressed in nice clothing. The man is leaning over the table with his hand on a glass looking at the woman with a soft smile.

The woman, siting upright, is speaking.","Well, it's a lovely gesture, but I still think we should start seeing other people.","This implies that the image on his forehead is a tattoo, as getting a tattoo of your significant other is a common practice","The humor in the caption hinges on a visual pun involving the man's large forehead, which reflects the outline of the woman sitting across from him. The setup implies that the man is so fixated on the woman that she is literally on his mind, mirrored by the reflection. The woman's response humorously contrasts with the implied affection by suggesting they should start seeing other people, despite the extreme and apparent devotion suggested by the man’s forehead reflection. The joke lies in the mismatch between the man's dedicated gesture and the woman's mundane suggestion to date others, creating a comedic tension between devotion and detachment.",gpt-4o,openai,
18,,16.0,"As a group of people exits a grand church doorway dressed in typical church attire, a pastor in a typical black suit and roman collar stands next to the Devil, complete with horns, trident, robe, and tail. They watch the procession pass by, as the pastor is explaining something to the devil. One passerby tips his hat at the pastor and devil.",I think it's important for them to hear both sides of the debate.,It downplays the seriousness of religion by portraying the Devil as merely the “other side” in a casual debate,"The humor in the caption comes from the juxtaposition of a serious topic with a comically absurd situation. Typically, in a church context, the ""debate"" between good and evil, often personified by God and the Devil, is not usually portrayed as a fair and balanced discourse where both sides should be heard. The pastor suggesting that the parishioners hear ""both sides"" humorously parallels how debates on moral or ethical issues are handled in secular settings, where balanced perspectives are encouraged. The absurdity is heightened by the literal presence of the Devil next to the pastor, treating the cosmic struggle of good versus evil as if it were a regular, everyday debate, akin to politics or public policy discussions, thus creating a humorous incongruity.",gpt-4o,openai,
20,,16.0,"As a group of people exits a grand church doorway dressed in typical church attire, a pastor in a typical black suit and roman collar stands next to the Devil, complete with horns, trident, robe, and tail. They watch the procession pass by, as the pastor is explaining something to the devil. One passerby tips his hat at the pastor and devil.","O.K., they're yours, but I still don't know where you got that fourth ace.","This implies a backstory that the pastor and devil were playing poker, the pastor lost, and the people were the bet.","The humor in this caption arises from the subversion of expectations and the blending of religious imagery with a poker game motif. In the typical understanding, the devil being involved signifies a sinister or deceitful deal, akin to ""selling one's soul."" By juxtaposing this serious context with the frivolous setting of a poker game, the caption suggests a humorous and unexpected scenario where the pastor and devil have wagered souls in a card game. The punchline centers on the notion of cheating in poker, evidenced by the devil mysteriously producing a fourth ace, which is typically impossible in a fair game. This implies the devil's trickery, making light of the idea of sinister deals by portraying them as mundane card games with innocuous banter, hence rendering the malevolent amusing.",gpt-4o,openai,
21,,20.0,"In a living room cocktail party setting, two couples in nice clothes are standing in a circle, holding champagne glasses. However one of the men is miniature, only reaching knee-hight. The other couple looks down on the tiny man, while the woman he is with is cheerfully speaking to the other couple. ","Whatever you do, don't agree to play hide-and-seek with him.",The man would be good at hide and seek because he is so small.,"The humor in the caption arises from the juxtaposition of the man's miniature size with the game of hide-and-seek, famously involving hiding one's body in creative ways to avoid being found. The tiny man's size provides a natural advantage in this game, as he can easily hide in places that full-sized people cannot, such as under furniture or inside small objects. The caption humorously advises the other couple not to play hide-and-seek with the tiny man because his size would make him almost impossible to find, turning a typical children's game into a hopeless challenge for his full-sized opponents. This creates a whimsical and absurd scenario that capitalizes on the visual gag of the man's unusual stature.",gpt-4o,openai,

The other couple looks down on the tiny man, while the woman he is with is cheerfully speaking to the other couple. ",We met at the mini bar.,"This combines the typical phrase ""we met at a bar"" with the term minibar, because the man himself is miniature.","The joke plays on the double meaning of the word ""mini"" to create a humorous connection between the man's small stature and the concept of a ""mini bar,"" which is a small drinks area in a hotel room. The humor arises from the idea that the woman's partner is literally mini-sized, leading to the punchline of having met him at a ""mini bar."" The expected meaning of 'mini bar' is overturned by the visual cue of the tiny man, creating an amusing twist where the literal and figurative interpretations of ""mini"" collide, and the cocktail party setting amplifies this play on words by linking to the context where one might typically encounter a mini bar.",gpt-4o,openai,

The other couple looks down on the tiny man, while the woman he is with is cheerfully speaking to the other couple. ",Larry can't tell you about his current project—it's top secret.,This implies that the man's top-secret project caused him to become tiny.,"The humor in this caption revolves around the juxtaposition of the tiny man's peculiar stature and the concept of working on a 'top secret' project. The phrase 'top secret' is typically used to indicate a project of high importance and discretion, often invoking imagery of significant or powerful endeavors. Here, the joke lies in the visual and verbal contradiction: a person of small physical stature humorously contrasts with the idea of working on an important, mysterious project. The use of 'top' also serves as a playful pun, as it humorously contrasts with the man's low physical height, making it an unexpected and amusing combination. The juxtaposition highlights the absurdity and exaggeration typical of New Yorker cartoons, where clever wordplay is used to surprise the audience.",gpt-4o,openai,
24,,23.0,"Two butterflies stand on adjascent twigs. While the butterfly on the left appears normal, the butterfly on the left's wings are replaced with the pattern of Piet Mondrian iconic ""Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow"". The butterfly on the right is speaking to the other butterfly.",But how will we raise the kids?,This is a reference to a common conversation had in mixed race/ethnicity/religion households,"The humor in this caption arises from the juxtaposition of the butterfly's natural appearance with the unexpected and incongruous pattern of a famous modern art piece, Piet Mondrian's ""Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow."" The question ""But how will we raise the kids?"" anthropomorphizes the butterflies, humorously suggesting that the artistic, abstract pattern of one butterfly might impact their offspring. It plays on the common parental concern of how different traits or influences will affect children, taken to a comical extreme by suggesting that the genetic impact of modern art aesthetics is a legitimate concern for butterflies. The absurdity lies in applying such a human cultural notion to butterflies, whose natural patterns are not consciously cultivated or influenced by art movements.",gpt-4o,openai,
26,,23.0,"Two butterflies stand on adjascent twigs. While the butterfly on the left appears normal, the butterfly on the left's wings are replaced with the pattern of Piet Mondrian iconic ""Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow"". The butterfly on the right is speaking to the other butterfly.",You think this is weird? My sister looks like a soup can.,"This implies there is a family of butterflies with patterns of famous paintings, in this case, Andy Warhol's soup can.","The humor in the caption arises from a playful reference to the distinctive art style of Piet Mondrian and the iconic imagery associated with Andy Warhol. The cartoon sets up the premise with one butterfly displaying Mondrian's geometric art on its wings. This alone is humorous due to the incongruity between complex art styles and natural butterfly wings. The punchline is delivered by the second butterfly, which suggests further eccentricities in the insect world by humorously claiming its sister resembles a soup can, an allusion to Warhol's famous Campbell's Soup Can painting. The caption builds on the initial absurdity, escalating the surreal art-underway concept with another iconic, yet unexpected, art reference. The juxtaposition of avant-garde art with nature-based subjects emphasizes the absurdity, which is the crux of the humor.",gpt-4o,openai,
27,,25.0,"In a social setting, several people are standing in a room wearing business attire and holding drinks. Two couples face each other, but the man in one of the couples is dressed in a full, vintage-style deep-sea diving suit, complete with a helmet and a hose attached to the back, looking somewhat uncomfortable.",This suit looked way better in the store.,"This is a play on words on ""suit,"" as in a formal suit or a diving suit.","The humor in this caption arises from the incongruity between the context and the situation. Social settings with partygoers typically involve casual or business attire, not a cumbersome, outdated deep-sea diving suit. The joke hinges on the absurdity of imagining someone trying on such an impractical outfit in a store and perceiving it as a legitimate option for a social event. Additionally, the caption plays on the expression ""looked better in the store,"" commonly used when something doesn't quite meet expectations once it's brought home — a mundane complaint applied here to an extremely out-of-place getup. The ridiculous visual of the diving suit juxtaposed with the normalcy of the setting amplifies the humor through its sheer oddness and the straight-faced nature of the caption. This creates a humorous contrast and a tongue-in-cheek commentary on fashion choices, making light of potential buyer's remorse in a hyperbolic scenario.",gpt-4o,openai,
28,,25.0,"In a social setting, several people are standing in a room wearing business attire and holding drinks. Two couples face each other, but the man in one of the couples is dressed in a full, vintage-style deep-sea diving suit, complete with a helmet and a hose attached to the back, looking somewhat uncomfortable.",Bob just came directly from work.,"This is a typical excuse for being underdressed for an event, implying that the man is a deep-sea diver for work.","The humor in this caption lies in the absurdity and incongruity of the situation. In normal circumstances, someone coming directly from work to a social gathering would wear business attire or perhaps a slightly more casual version. However, the man is wearing an impractical and cumbersome deep-sea diving suit, an outfit completely unsuitable for any typical workplace or social setting. This exaggerates and mocks the concept of “coming directly from work” by suggesting that his bizarre and inappropriate attire is just another day-to-day work outfit. The caption contrasts the mundane expectation of work attire with the fantastical idea of someone working in a job that involves wearing such an unusual outfit to the party, highlighting the humor in the juxtaposition.",gpt-4o,openai,
29,,25.0,"In a social setting, several people are standing in a room wearing business attire and holding drinks.

The juxtaposition is comical because a professional and high-tech piece of equipment, meant for underwater exploration, is being humorously minimized to perform a trivial task. Additionally, the caption switches conversational topics in an unexpected way—from a personal, serious matter of their sex life to a humorous, incongruous solution to a common problem—enhancing the absurdity. This unexpected twist is a classic New Yorker cartoon punchline technique that draws humor from the absurdity and surprise factor.",gpt-4o,openai,
30,,27.0,"Several men in suits are seated around a boardroom table with coffee mugs and documents. At the head of the table, one man is standing with his arms crossed. Everyone seated has a parrot sitting on their shoulder. One seated person with a parrot is speaking angrily to the man to his left.",We have to find a better way to record our meetings.,Parrots are known to repeat language,"The humor in this caption lies in the visual pun and wordplay. Parrots are commonly known for their ability to mimic human speech, often repeating what they hear. In the context of a board meeting, recording conversations is a standard practice, typically done with devices like tape recorders or digital recorders. Here, the parrots on the participants' shoulders serve as a humorous and absurd substitute for recording devices, since they could ""record"" by repeating the discussions. The irony of suggesting they ""find a better way"" to record their meetings implies that relying on parrots—a comically inefficient and unpredictable method—is not effective. The juxtaposition of a formal corporate setting with the whimsical and impractical use of parrots for documentation injects an element of the absurd, creating humor from the clash between serious business conduct and silly, literal visual gags.",gpt-4o,openai,

One seated person with a parrot is speaking angrily to the man to his left.","Well, it's not my fault booty revenues are down this quarter.","Parrots and ""booty"" are both concepts tied to pirates, implying that the company is actually a pirate operation","The humor in this caption arises from the incongruity and surprise generated by the corporate boardroom setting combined with the pirate-themed element of each man having a parrot on his shoulder. Usually associated with pirates, the presence of parrots humorously suggests that these businessmen are, in some farcical way, engaged in pirate-like activities. The punchline comes from the character defensively explaining a decline in ""booty revenues,"" which is a playful twist on the professional jargon typically used in business meetings (""revenues"" or ""profits"") combined with the pirate term ""booty,"" meaning treasure. This creates a comical scenario where these serious-looking business people are discussing pirate plunder in a business context, underpinning the absurdity and resulting humor in the caption.",gpt-4o,openai,

In the cartoon, the men in suits are mirroring pirate imagery by having parrots on their shoulders, which is an amusing juxtaposition given the formal setting of a boardroom meeting. The anger expressed by the speaker suggests Bob is trying to pass off something fake (a clip-on parrot) as real. The absurdity of parrots as formal accessories, combined with the notion of authenticity and the unexpected comparison to clip-on accessories, creates the joke. The idea of parrots, traditionally living creatures, being used as clip-ons is ridiculous, enhancing the humor.",gpt-4o,openai,
33,,29.0,"A bald man in glasses and a suit points at a chart on an easel with a stick.

In schools, ""recess"" is a break from class where children can play, typically used to encourage attention by promising a fun break afterward. Here, the speaker humorously addresses a presumably senior, perhaps slightly inattentive government official as one might address an easily distracted child.

However, the presence of the mysterious figure in dark glasses and a trench coat, a stereotypical depiction of a spy or detective, adds an unexpected literal interpretation to the phrase. Instead of relying on standard medical monitoring techniques, the implication is that the figure will physically surveil the patient's rash, akin to an undercover operation.

Her disappointed tone suggests that she had entertained the idea of a future commitment or marriage, which is ironic given the context of a brief and unlikely romantic encounter with a supernatural being.

However, in this context, the lawyer humorously requests permission not to approach the witness.

The punchline is delivered through the term ""too waspy,"" which is a clever double entendre. In one sense, it refers to ""WASP,"" an acronym for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, stereotypically associated with liking refined, traditional cuisine. Simultaneously, ""waspy"" alludes to the wasp-like nature of the insect, enhancing the absurdity of an anthropomorphized bug critiquing gourmet insect fare.

By warning about a moose head elsewhere, the joke implies that the house is full of mounted animals capable of surprising actions, even though mounted animals are typically inanimate and harmless.

The punchline implies that the building’s elevator might also operate unusually, potentially moving horizontally or in some bizarre manner that could make using it confusing or disorienting. This incongruity between everyday expectations (elevators moving vertically in straight lines) and the visual absurdity of the building’s construction creates a humorous situation, as it playfully expands on the unconventional architecture with a relatable yet ridiculous challenge for anyone trying to navigate the building.",gpt-4o,openai,
97,,79.0,"Two men in suits are standing on a sidewalk near a fire hydrant, looking up at an apartment building. All the windows on the building are rotated 90 degrees, so they appear sideways, including a man leaning out of one window, who is also rotated to match the window’s orientation. The two men on the sidewalk appear perplexed or curious about the unusual building.",I think I liked them the other way.,"Presumably, making the building sideways was a large undertaking that affected many people. Saying that he liked it the other way implies that all that effort was for nothing.","The humor in this caption stems from the understatement and the absurdity of the situation. The cartoon depicts a surreal scenario where all windows of the building are turned sideways, defying the normal orientation. The caption “I think I liked them the other way” is humorously understated, as if this bizarre and physically improbable change in window orientation is simply a matter of personal preference, like rearranging furniture. The caption plays on the viewer’s expectation of a more dramatic reaction to such an odd sight, employing deadpan humor to create a contrast between the normalcy of the speaker’s tone and the abnormality of the situation.",gpt-4o,openai,

The man is holding a phone to his ear and looking backward at a large hand extending from a cloud, which is pointing accusatorily downward at him. The woman looks alarmed or confused as she runs alongside him through tall grass away from the hand. In the background, a snake is wrapped around a tree trunk. Rays of light shine down dramatically.",I gotta go. ‘Mr. Wonderful’ is having one of his episodes.,"By referring to God as ""Mr. Wonderful"" and calling the divine judgement an ""episode,"" Adam is characterizing God as a flawed, overly dramatic individual","This caption plays on the biblical story of Adam and Eve and humorously imagines a modern twist where the man, presumably Adam, is on the phone dismissing God's accusatory gesture by referring to God as ""Mr. Wonderful."" The term ""episodes"" suggests a history of dramatic or unpredictable behavior, implying that this is nothing new to Adam, adding an air of nonchalance to a typically profound or serious event. The humor arises from contrasting the divine and sacred setting of the Garden of Eden with the mundane and casual language typical in describing an ordinary domestic or social issue, reducing the gravity of divine retribution to the level of a quirky personality trait. This discrepancy between sacred and mundane contexts creates the comedic effect.",gpt-4o,openai,

Rays of light shine down dramatically.",It's like paradise for the first few days. But you wouldn't want to live here,The man is speaking about the Garden of Eden as if it's a vacation destination,"The joke in this caption hinges on the juxtaposition of the idyllic setting of the Garden of Eden, typically associated with eternal paradise, with a modern, somewhat cynical perspective of vacationing. The statement ""It's like paradise for the first few days. But you wouldn't want to live here"" mirrors the common sentiment about holiday destinations being great for short visits but not practical for long-term living. In the context of the cartoon, it humorously implies that even the perfect paradise of Eden might lose its charm after a while, especially with the divine hand of God pointing accusingly—suggesting trouble, such as being caught doing something wrong. This incongruity between the idealized notion of Eden and the pragmatic view of it as an inconvenient place to live creates a humorous tension that underlies the caption.",gpt-4o,openai,

The cartoon features a depiction of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, referencing their biblical narrative of encountering temptation and committing the original sin. Here, the man's use of a phone introduces an anachronistic element, creating a comedic clash. The caption humorously suggests that the man is casually speaking to Satan on the phone, anthropomorphizing the biblical villain into a modern acquaintance. The punchline relies on the familiar trope of a ""call-back"" to convey a sense of triviality, highlighting the absurdity of prioritizing a phone call with Satan over the immediate divine accusation depicted in the cartoon. This juxtaposition of the sacred and the mundane, along with the surprise element that Adam would even have Satan's contact information, adds layers to the joke and creates humor.",gpt-4o,openai,
101,,83.0,"A group of people is sitting and talking casually in a living room. However, the room is filled with absurdly oversized household items, including giant lamps towering over the furniture and a massive telephone in the foreground. In the background, a separate room is visible, filled with a giant toaster and other huge kitchen appliances.","You know how it is—first you buy the giant-screen television, then nothing else seems to match.","This explains the large furniture as the result of everything feeling small after buying a large TV, an otherwise normal item","The humor in this caption comes from a play on the idea that once someone purchases a large item, typically a ""giant-screen television,"" it creates a pressure or a desire to buy similarly sized, disproportionate items. The caption takes this common notion to the absurd by suggesting that in order for everything to match, regular household items need to be enormous, leading to this ridiculous setting where everything, from lamps to kitchen appliances, is comically oversized. The joke lies in exaggerating the lifestyle of wanting everything to aesthetically or proportionally match, which in this context results in an impractical and humorous living space filled with oversized objects.",gpt-4o,openai,

The cartoon features a living room filled with comically oversized household items, which creates an exaggerated and surreal environment. The caption ""It's down the hall, but don't fall in,"" humorously suggests that the giant items, specifically a bathroom, might be so large or unusual that someone could literally 'fall in' to it. This creates a humorous mental image of someone being unexpectedly consumed by ordinary household amenities, playing on the absurdity of the oversized items and the viewers' expectations of normal household dynamics. The line cleverly combines an element of caution with a subtle nod to the continued absurdity of the scene.",gpt-4o,openai,

The oversized items suggest that a normal-sized piece of toast would be enormous, which plays on the absurdity of serving tiny portions to match the exaggerated scale. The specificity of ""1/68th"" adds humor by its precision, contrasting with the normally casual nature of offering food, and emphasizing the exaggerated proportions of the setting.",gpt-4o,openai,

However, instead of a golf course, they are looking at a field filled with barbed wire, tanks, and machine guns. A golf flag is visible in the background, alongside scattered trees and clouds.","I support our troops as much as the next guy, but do we have to let them play through?",The army is also playing on the golf course,"The humor in this caption arises from the incongruity and absurdity of combining golf etiquette with a military battlefield. In golf, ""playing through"" is a common courtesy allowing faster players to pass slower ones. The caption humorously suggests that the golfers are treating the military presence on the field as a group of players who might 'play through,' despite the evident danger and serious nature of a battlefield with barbed wire, tanks, and machine guns. The phrase ""I support our troops"" is also a familiar expression of patriotism, typically unrelated to a leisure activity like golf. This juxtaposition between the casual, privileged world of golf and the dangerous, serious world of warfare creates a comedic contrast that highlights the absurdity of maintaining golf etiquette in such an unsuitable context.",gpt-4o,openai,

Normally, ""Bombs away!"" is an exclamation used in military contexts, referring to the dropping of bombs. In the cartoon, the golfers are on what appears to be a battlefield rather than a typical golf course, so the phrase takes on a literal and comically inappropriate tone. The golfer named Tom is shouting ""Bombs away!"" while hitting a golf ball, an activity that usually involves calm and peacefulness, starkly contrasting with the militaristic environment they're in. The juxtaposition of this military imagery with the inappropriately enthusiastic phrase creates the humor, as it suggests Tom's obliviousness to the potentially dangerous or serious nature of their unconventional golfing environment.",gpt-4o,openai,

The man is reaching into his pocket as if to give something to a dolphin standing upright on its tail, which is holding out a cup in a begging gesture. The woman, appearing angry, is yelling at the man, likely in protest of his action.","Come on, George. You know he's only going to spend it on more oxygen.",A common argument for not giving money to beggars is the belief that they'll spend the money on alcohol or drugs.,"This caption plays on the familiar social trope of people warning against giving money to beggars because they might spend it on less-than-desirable ends, often alcohol or other vices. Here, the humor arises from the absurdity of applying this stereotype to a dolphin in a city setting, which is ridiculous because dolphins don’t belong on city streets and certainly wouldn’t beg for money. The punchline, ""he's only going to spend it on more oxygen,"" extends the absurdity: unlike humans, dolphins need oxygen to survive as they breathe through blowholes, turning a serious vice into a basic necessity. The humor lies in the misapplication of a human social concern to an animal in an impossible situation.",gpt-4o,openai,
