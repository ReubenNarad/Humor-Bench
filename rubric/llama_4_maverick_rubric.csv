The person at the head of the table is speaking.","This is my stop. Phil, you'll be CEO til 63rd street.","The caption implies that because this business meets on public transit, their leadership is determined by who is currently riding","The joke is that the person at the head of the table, likely the current CEO, is announcing that they are leaving the meeting (and possibly the company) because they have reached their stop on the public transportation vehicle. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on a typical corporate succession scenario, with the CEO's departure being dictated by the bus/subway route rather than a traditional retirement or career change.

I miss the corporate jet very much.",This implies that holding meetings on public transit is a downgrade for the organization,"The joke is that the speaker is nostalgic for the luxury of a corporate jet, but they are currently in a mundane and crowded public transportation setting, starkly contrasting with the opulence they miss. The humor lies in the juxtaposition of the high-end business perk (corporate jet) with the ordinary, even plebeian, surroundings (a bus or subway car), highlighting the speaker's likely misplaced priorities or obliviousness to their current environment.",meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8,together,PASS

The humor comes from the absurdity of holding a formal meeting in an unconventional and chaotic environment, and the added layer of irony that they're still referencing the traditional office setting as a plausible reason for being late.",meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8,together,FAIL

That floor was waxed last night!,"The woman's callous attitude towards the man in need contradicts what we expect from an emergency hotline worker, who typically aims to be helpful","The joke is that the disheveled man is expected to be in a state of distress or emergency, given the ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE"" sign, but instead he's concerned about damaging the floor, implying that his situation isn't actually an emergency. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the typical expectation of someone calling an emergency hotline, and the man's nonchalant complaint about the waxed floor, which is a mundane concern.",meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8,together,FAIL

One host in the middle, a woman, leans over the desk with both hands, yelling angrily at the man crawling on the ground.","Neither the time nor the place, Doug!","Typically, the emergency hotline is exactly the time and place for a person in need of help.","The joke is that the woman's outburst, ""Neither the time nor the place, Doug!"", is a phrase typically used to scold someone for being overly affectionate or romantic in an inappropriate setting. However, the context of the cartoon - an ""EMERGENCY HOTLINE"" with a disheveled man crawling in front of them - suggests a much more dire situation, making the woman's reprimand hilariously incongruous and implying that ""Doug"" is being inappropriate even in a crisis, highlighting the absurdity of the hosts' priorities.",meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8,together,FAIL

The humor comes from the unexpected twist on what an ""emergency"" is, as the hosts are annoyed that the man hasn't used his phone's roaming minutes, implying he's calling from elsewhere, rather than responding to his dire situation.

However, given the extraordinary and obvious fact that the window is open to outer space, with the Earth visible outside, the husband's casual dismissal is absurdly inadequate, as the actual issue is the catastrophic and surreal fact that they are not in a normal bedroom.

The speaker describes the miniature man on the island as ""the cutest little thing,"" creating an initial impression of affection. However, the punchline subverts this expectation by casually mentioning that he can be flushed down the toilet when they're done with him, implying a disturbing disposability.

The humor arises from the unexpected twist on the typical golfing phrase ""Fore!"" (a warning shouted to alert others that a golf ball is heading in their direction) being replaced with ""Bombs away!"", a phrase associated with military bombing runs. The caption's humor stems from the juxtaposition of golfing and warfare, and the character's habitual, yet misplaced, enthusiasm in the wrong context.",meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8,together,FAIL
106,86,"Two golfers stand on a grassy field, each holding golf clubs in bags slung over their shoulders. However, instead of a golf course, they are looking at a field filled with barbed wire, tanks, and machine guns. A golf flag is visible in the background, alongside scattered trees and clouds.","If we truly believe in golf, I don't think we have much of a choice.",This is something a soldier would say before going into battle.,"The joke lies in the unexpected juxtaposition of a serene golf scene with a war-torn landscape. The caption implies that the golfers are so committed to their sport that they're willing to play it in a battlefield, highlighting the absurdity of their situation. The humor stems from the deadpan seriousness of the statement, suggesting that their faith in golf somehow necessitates playing on a hazardous terrain, rather than acknowledging the obvious danger.",meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8,together,FAIL
107,92,"A man and a woman stand on a city sidewalk. The man is reaching into his pocket as if to give something to a dolphin standing upright on its tail, which is holding out a cup in a begging gesture. The woman, appearing angry, is yelling at the man, likely in protest of his action.","Come on, George. You know he's only going to spend it on more oxygen.",A common argument for not giving money to beggars is the belief that they'll spend the money on alcohol or drugs.,"The joke relies on a play on the common stereotype that a particular group (often associated with a negative trait) will waste money on something specific. Here, the punchline subverts expectations by applying this trope to a dolphin, implying it's prone to overspending on ""oxygen"", a humorous and literal necessity for a dolphin. The humor comes from the unexpected application of a human-like flaw to an animal and the absurdity of a dolphin needing to ""spend"" money on something as essential as oxygen.",meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8,together,PASS
